Analysis of six studies involving 326 participants regarding our primary outcome, ADL, showed no evidence of an effect in favour of tDCS at the end of the intervention phase (mean difference (MD) 5.31 Barthel Index (BI) points; 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.52 to 11.14; inverse variance method with random-effects model), whereas at follow-up (MD 11.13 BI points; 95% CI 2.89 to 19.37; inverse variance method with random-effects model), we found evidence of an effect. However, the confidence intervals were wide and the effect was not sustained when only studies with low risk of bias were included.

"Polarizing cerebellar neurons with transcranial Direct Current Stimulation.","Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology",2013,,,Array,Array,24176296,,"Purpose: To assess the effects of atDCS on motor performance in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Previously, anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (atDCS) has been shown to improve motor performance in healthy subjects and neurodegenerative populations. However, the effect of atDCS on motor performance is not examined in MS. Methods: In the current study, a sham controlled double-blind crossover design was used to evaluate the effect of 20 minutes of 1 mA atDCS or sham tDCS (stDCS) on a unimanual motor sequence-training task, consisting of sequential finger presses on a computer keyboard with the most impaired hand. Patients received stimulation (atDCS or stDCS) during motor training. tDCS was applied over the primary motor cortex contralateral to the most impaired hand. Motor performance was assessed immediately before, during and 30 minutes after stimulation. Results: Although we need to be careful with the interpretation of the data due to lack of power, our results showed no significant effect of atDCS on motor performance. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that atDCS-supported motor training was not able to improve motor performance more than sham-supported motor training. Possibly, the effects of atDCS are mediated by specific MS-related characteristics. Furthermore, increasing atDCS intensity and offering multiple stimulation sessions might be necessary to optimize motor performance resulting from atDCS-supported motor training."
"A single session of 1 mA anodal tDCS-supported motor training does not improve motor performance in patients with multiple sclerosis.","Restorative neurology and neuroscience",2013,,,Array,Array,24169364,,"Rhythmic neuronal activity is ubiquitous in the human brain. These rhythms originate from a variety of different network mechanisms, which give rise to a wide-ranging spectrum of oscillation frequencies. In the last few years an increasing number of clinical research studies have explored transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) with weak current as a tool for affecting brain function. The premise of these interventions is that tACS will interact with ongoing brain oscillations. However, the exact mechanisms by which weak currents could affect neuronal oscillations at different frequency bands are not well known and this, in turn, limits the rational optimization of human experiments. Here we review the available in vitro and in vivo animal studies that attempt to provide mechanistic explanations. The findings can be summarized into a few generic principles, such as periodic modulation of excitability, shifts in spike timing, modulation of firing rate, and shifts in the balance of excitation and inhibition. These effects result from weak but simultaneous polarization of a large number of neurons. Whether this can lead to an entrainment or a modulation of brain oscillations, or whether AC currents have no effect at all, depends entirely on the specific dynamic that gives rise to the different brain rhythms, as discussed here for slow wave oscillations (∼1 Hz) and gamma oscillations (∼30 Hz). We conclude with suggestions for further experiments to investigate the role of AC stimulation for other physiologically relevant brain rhythms."
"Effects of weak transcranial alternating current stimulation on brain activity-a review of known mechanisms from animal studies.","Frontiers in human neuroscience",2013,,7,Array,Array,24167483,,"Background and purpose: Recent research suggests that an increased level of stroke-affected left hemisphere cortical (especially frontal) excitability is associated with better language improvement in aphasic patients. Anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (A-tDCS), increasing cortical activity, may facilitate perilesional left hemisphere recruitment to subserve language processing and enhance effects of behavioural therapy. The aim of the study (randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled) was to evaluate the effectiveness of repeated A-tDCS over Broca area as a strategy to enhance aphasia recovery during early post-stroke rehabilitation. Material and methods: Thirty-seven participants with moderate or severe aphasia were randomized to receive 15 consecutive daily sessions of A-tDCS (1 mA, 10 min; experimental group, n = 18) or sham stimulation (1 mA, 25 s; control group, n = 19) followed by language therapy. Effects of tDCS were assessed using the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination, performed before and after the rehabilitation, and three months later. Results: The results did not confirm a positive impact of repeated A-tDCS, preceding language therapy, on language abilities in our patients. Although both groups improved after the therapy, there were no statistically significant differences between groups in either short-term or long-term tDCS effects. Effect sizes for the experimental group, at post-treatment and the 3-month follow-up, were slightly higher than in controls but insufficient to infer any beneficial influence of the applied intervention. Conclusions: The findings do not support A-tDCS functional benefits during early rehabilitation of post-stroke aphasia. Further research is needed to explore the effectiveness of this kind of neuromodulation."
"No effects of anodal transcranial direct stimulation on language abilities in early rehabilitation of post-stroke aphasic patients.","Neurologia i neurochirurgia polska",,,47,Array,Array,24166562,5,"The threshold and direction of excitability changes induced by low- and high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in the primary motor cortex can be effectively reverted by a preceding session of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a phenomenon referred to as ""metaplasticity"". Here, we used a combined tDCS-rTMS protocol and visual evoked potentials (VEPs) in healthy subjects to provide direct electrophysiological evidence for metaplasticity in the human visual cortex. Specifically, we evaluated changes in VEPs at two different contrasts (90 and 20 %) before and at different time points after the application of anodal or cathodal tDCS to occipital cortex (i.e., priming), followed by an additional conditioning with low- or high-frequency rTMS. Anodal tDCS increased the amplitude of VEPs and this effect was paradoxically reverted by applying high-frequency (5 Hz), conventionally excitatory rTMS (p < 0.0001). Similarly, cathodal tDCS led to a decrease in VEPs amplitude, which was reverted by a subsequent application of conventionally inhibitory, 1 Hz rTMS (p < 0.0001). Similar changes were observed for both the N1 and P1 component of the VEP. There were no significant changes in resting motor threshold values (p > 0.5), confirming the spatial selectivity of our conditioning protocol. Our findings show that preconditioning primary visual area excitability with tDCS can modulate the direction and strength of plasticity induced by subsequent application of 1 or 5 Hz rTMS. These data indicate the presence of mechanisms of metaplasticity that keep synaptic strengths within a functional dynamic range in the human visual cortex."
"Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation in a Patient With Schizoaffective Disorder Manic Episode.","Neuromodulation : journal of the International Neuromodulation Society",2013,,,Array,Array,24165097,,"Recent studies show that acute neuromodulation of the prefrontal cortex with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can decrease food craving, attentional bias to food, and actual food intake. These data suggest potential clinical applications for tDCS in the field of obesity. However, optimal stimulation parameters in obese individuals are uncertain. One fundamental concern is whether a thick, low-conductivity layer of subcutaneous fat around the head can affect current density distribution and require dose adjustments during tDCS administration. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of head fat on the distribution of current during tDCS and evaluate whether dosing standards for tDCS developed for adult individuals in general are adequate for the obese population. We used MRI-derived high-resolution computational models that delineated fat layers in five human heads from subjects with body mass index (BMI) ranging from ""normal-lean"" to ""super-obese"" (20.9 to 53.5 kg/m(2)). Data derived from these simulations suggest that head fat influences tDCS current density across the brain, but its relative contribution is small when other components of head anatomy are added. Current density variability between subjects does not appear to have a direct and/or simple link to BMI. These results indicate that guidelines for the use of tDCS can be extrapolated to obese subjects without sacrificing efficacy and/or treatment safety; the recommended standard parameters can lead to the delivery of adequate current flow to induce neuromodulation of brain activity in the obese population."
"Evidence for metaplasticity in the human visual cortex.","Journal of neural transmission (Vienna, Austria : 1996)",2013,,,Array,Array,24162796,,"Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) is investigated for a broad range of neuropsychiatric indications, various rehabilitation applications, and to modulate cognitive performance in diverse tasks. Specificity of tDCS refers broadly to the ability of tDCS to produce precise, as opposed to diffuse, changes in brain function. Practically, specificity of tDCS implies application-specific customization of protocols to maximize desired outcomes and minimize undesired effects. Especially given the simplicity of tDCS and the complexity of brain function, understanding the mechanisms leading to specificity is fundamental to the rational advancement of tDCS. We define the origins of specificity based on anatomical and functional factors. Anatomical specificity derives from guiding current to targeted brain structures. Functional specificity may derive from either activity-selectivity, where active neuronal networks are preferentially modulated by tDCS, or input-selectivity, where bias is applied to different synaptic inputs. Rational advancement of tDCS may require leveraging all forms of specificity."

Recent studies revealed time-dependent consolidation as a common feature of visuomotor tasks. We have previously shown that anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in combination with repeated motor training benefits consolidation by the induction of offline skill gains in a complex visuomotor task, preventing the regular occurrence of skill loss between days. Here, we asked 2 questions: What is the time course of consolidation between days for this task and do exogenously induced offline gains develop as a function of time or overnight sleep? We found that both the development of offline skill loss in sham-stimulated subjects and offline skill gains induced by anodal tDCS critically depend on the passage of time after training, but not on overnight sleep. These findings support the view that tDCS interacts directly with the physiological consolidation process. However, in a control experiment, anodal tDCS applied after the training did not induce skill gains, implying that coapplication of tDCS and training is required to induce offline skill gains, pointing to the initiation of consolidation already during training."

We present the first comprehensive and technical review, explaining the evolution of tES in both terminology and dosage over the past 100 years of research to present day. Current transcranial Pulsed Current Stimulation (tPCS) approaches such as Cranial Electrotherapy Stimulation (CES) descended from Electrosleep (ES) through Cranial Electro-stimulation Therapy (CET), Transcerebral Electrotherapy (TCET), and NeuroElectric Therapy (NET) while others like Transcutaneous Cranial Electrical Stimulation (TCES) descended from Electroanesthesia (EA) through Limoge, and Interferential Stimulation. Prior to a contemporary resurgence in interest, variations of transcranial Direct Current Stimulation were explored intermittently, including Polarizing current, Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation (GVS), and Transcranial Micropolarization. The development of these approaches alongside Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) and pharmacological developments are considered. Both the roots and unique features of contemporary approaches such as transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation (tACS) and transcranial Random Noise Stimulation (tRNS) are discussed. Trends and incremental developments in electrode montage and waveform spanning decades are presented leading to the present day. Commercial devices, seminal conferences, and regulatory decisions are noted.

"Brain stimulation paired with novel locomotor training with robotic gait orthosis in chronic stroke: a feasibility study.",NeuroRehabilitation,2013,e43-4,33,Array,Array,9444471,1,"Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is an innovative method to explore the causal structure-function relationship of brain areas. We investigated the specificity of bilateral bi-cephalic tDCS with two active electrodes of the same polarity (e.g., cathodal on both hemispheres) applied to intraparietal cortices bilaterally using a combined between- and within-task approach. Regarding between-task specificity, we observed that bilateral bi-cephalic tDCS affected a numerical (mental addition) but not a control task (colour word Stroop), indicating a specific influence of tDCS on numerical but not on domain general cognitive processes associated with the bilateral IPS. In particular, the numerical effect of distractor distance was more pronounced under cathodal than under anodal stimulation. Moreover, with respect to within-task specificity we only found the numerical distractor distance effect in mental addition to be modulated by direct current stimulation, whereas the effect of target identity was not affected. This implies a differential influence of bilateral bi-cephalic tDCS on the recruitment of different processing components within the same task (number magnitude processing vs. recognition of familiarity). In sum, this first successful application of bilateral bi-cephalic tDCS with two active electrodes of the same polarity in numerical cognition research corroborates the specific proposition of the Triple Code Model that number magnitude information is represented bilaterally in the intraparietal cortices."

"Transcranial direct current stimulation of the primary motor cortex affects cortical drive to human musculature as assessed by intermuscular coherence.","The Journal of physiology",2006,795-803,577,Array,Array,17023507,"Pt 3","Intermuscular coherence analysis can be used to assess the common drive to muscles. Coherence in the beta-frequency band (15-35 Hz) is thought to arise from common cortical sources. Intermuscular coherence analysis is a potentially attractive tool for the investigation of motor cortical excitability changes because it is non-invasive and can be done relatively quickly. We carried out this study to test the hypothesis that intermuscular coherence analysis was able to detect cortical excitability changes in healthy subjects following transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). tDCS has been shown to increase (anodal stimulation) or decrease (cathodal stimulation) the size of the muscle potential evoked by TMS. We found that anodal tDCS caused an increase in motor evoked potential (MEP) size that was paralleled by an increase in beta-band intermuscular coherence. Similarly, the reduction in MEP size produced by cathodal tDCS was paralleled by a reduction in beta-band intermuscular coherence, while sham stimulation did not result in any change in either MEP amplitude or beta-band intermuscular coherence. The similar pattern of change observed for MEP and intermuscular coherence may indicate similar mechanisms of action, although this cannot be assumed without further investigation. These changes do suggest that at least some of the action of tDCS is on cortical networks, and that combined tDCS and intermuscular coherence analysis may be useful in the diagnosis of pathologies affecting motor cortical excitability."

It can enhance motor learning and working memory in healthy subjects. To investigate the effects of anodal tDCS (1 mA, 20 min) of the dominant and non-dominant primary motor cortex (M1) on hand motor performance in healthy right-handed volunteers, healthy subjects underwent one session of both sham and active anodal stimulation of the non-dominant or dominant primary motor cortex. A blinded rater assessed motor function using the Jebsen Taylor Hand Function Test. For the non-dominant hand, active tDCS was able to improve motor function significantly-there was a significant interaction between time and condition of stimulation (p = 0.003). Post hoc tests showed a significant enhancement of JTT performance after 1 mA anodal tDCS of M1 (mean improvement of 9.41%, p = 0.0004), but not after sham tDCS (mean improvement of 1.3%, p = 0.84). For the dominant hand, however, neither active nor sham tDCS resulted in a significant change in motor performance. Our findings show that anodal tDCS of the non-dominant primary motor cortex results in motor function enhancement and thus confirm and extend the notion that tDCS can change behavior. We speculate that the under-use of the non-dominant hand with its associated consequences in cortical plasticity might be one of the reasons to explain motor performance enhancement in the non-dominant hand only."

Because transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is capable of inducing lasting changes of cortical excitability, we investigated the after-effects of tDCS on the propagation velocity of CSD in the rat. Twenty-five anesthetised rats received either anodal, cathodal or sham tDCS. The stimulation was applied for 20 min at a current strength of 200 microA after the recording of three baseline CSD measurements. Starting 5 min after tDCS, a further three CSDs were elicited and CSD velocity recorded at intervals of 20 min. tDCS and CSD recording was performed under anaesthesia with chloralose and urethane. As compared to the baseline velocity of 3.14 mm/min, anodal tDCS induced a significant increase of propagation velocity during the first post-tDCS recording (3.49 mm/min). In contrast to anodal tDCS, neither cathodal tDCS nor sham tDCS, which consisted of an initial ramped DC stimulation lasting only 20 s, showed a significant effect on CSD propagation velocity. As anodal tDCS is known to induce a lasting increase of cortical excitability in the clinical setting, our results support the notion that CSD propagation velocity reflects cortical excitability. Since cortical excitability and susceptibility to CSD is elevated in migraine patients, anodal tDCS - by increasing cortical excitability - might increase the probability of migraine attack in these patients, even beyond the end of its application."

The guiding theory is that impairment of hand function is exacerbated by learned non-use and that this in turn leads to a loss of cortical representation of the upper limb. It is claimed that these processes can be reversed by two weeks of constraint of the unaffected limb combined with intensive practice in use of the paretic hand, and numerous small-scale studies have suggested that CIMT can lead to large improvements in function more than a year after stroke. However, the theory of learned non-use is open to question and there is uncertainty about the nature of the improvements induced by CIMT. The greatest effect seems to be increased spontaneous use of the hand, either through reduction of learned non-use or by overcoming the sense of effort during movement. There is also evidence of some improvement on dexterity tests but no studies have analysed in detail whether this reflects reduction of basic motor impairment or learning of compensatory movement strategies. The current weight of evidence is in favour of compensatory learning. Cortical changes detected by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) or functional imaging may reflect this compensatory motor skill learning rather than restoration of representations lost due to the infarct or non-use of the limb. If future studies confirm this then the clinical implication is that direct teaching of unimanual or bimanual compensatory strategies might be a more productive approach than constraint."

"Modulating parameters of excitability during and after transcranial direct current stimulation of the human motor cortex.","The Journal of physiology",2005,291-303,568,Array,Array,16002441,"Pt 1","Weak transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the human motor cortex results in excitability shifts which occur during and after stimulation. These excitability shifts are polarity-specific with anodal tDCS enhancing excitability, and cathodal reducing it. To explore the origin of this excitability modulation in more detail, we measured the input-output curve and motor thresholds as global parameters of cortico-spinal excitability, and determined intracortical inhibition and facilitation, as well as facilitatory indirect wave (I-wave) interactions. Measurements were performed during short-term tDCS, which elicits no after-effects, and during other tDCS protocols which do elicit short- and long-lasting after-effects. Resting and active motor thresholds remained stable during and after tDCS. The slope of the input-output curve was increased by anodal tDCS and decreased by cathodal tDCS. Anodal tDCS of the primary motor cortex reduced intracortical inhibition and enhanced facilitation after tDCS but not during tDCS. Cathodal tDCS reduced facilitation during, and additionally increased inhibition after its administration. During tDCS, I-wave facilitation was not influenced but, for the after-effects, anodal tDCS increased I-wave facilitation, while cathodal tDCS had only minor effects. These results suggest that the effect of tDCS on cortico-spinal excitability during a short period of stimulation (which does not induce after-effects) primarily depends on subthreshold resting membrane potential changes, which are able to modulate the input-output curve, but not motor thresholds. In contrast, the after-effects of tDCS are due to shifts in intracortical inhibition and facilitation, and at least partly also to facilitatory I-wave interaction, which is controlled by synaptic activity."

Our aim was to determine whether anodal transcranial direct current stimulation, which enhances brain cortical excitability and activity, would modify performance in a sequential-letter working memory task when administered to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Fifteen subjects underwent a three-back working memory task based on letters. This task was performed during sham and anodal stimulation applied over the left DLPFC. Moreover seven of these subjects performed the same task, but with inverse polarity (cathodal stimulation of the left DLPFC) and anodal stimulation of the primary motor cortex (M1). Our results indicate that only anodal stimulation of the left prefrontal cortex, but not cathodal stimulation of left DLPFC or anodal stimulation of M1, increases the accuracy of the task performance when compared to sham stimulation of the same area. This accuracy enhancement during active stimulation cannot be accounted for by slowed responses, as response times were not changed by stimulation. Our results indicate that left prefrontal anodal stimulation leads to an enhancement of working memory performance. Furthermore, this effect depends on the stimulation polarity and is specific to the site of stimulation. This result may be helpful to develop future interventions aiming at clinical benefits."
"Homeostatic-like plasticity of the primary motor hand area is impaired in focal hand dystonia.","Brain : a journal of neurology",2005,291-303,128,Array,Array,9818853,"Pt 8","The excitability of inhibitory circuits in patients with writer's cramp is reduced at multiple levels within the sensorimotor system, including the primary motor hand area (M1). Although this may play a major role in the pathophysiology of writer's cramp, it is still unclear what factors may cause the imbalance between inhibition and excitation to arise. One possibility is that homeostatic mechanisms that keep cortical excitability within a normal physiological range are impaired. In eight patients with writer's cramp and eight healthy age-matched controls, we combined low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) with transcranial direct current stimulation (TDCS) to probe regional homeostatic plasticity of the left M1. Confirming our previous study (Siebner et al., J Neurosci 2004; 24: 3379-85), 'facilitatory' preconditioning of the M1 with anodal TDCS enhanced the inhibitory effect of subsequent 1 Hz rTMS on corticospinal excitability. Conversely, 'inhibitory' preconditioning with cathodal TDCS reversed the after effect of 1 Hz rTMS, producing an increase in corticospinal excitability. The results were quite different in patients with writer's cramp. Following preconditioning with TDCS, 1 Hz rTMS induced no consistent changes in corticospinal excitability, indicating a loss of the normal 'homeostatic' response pattern. In addition, the normal inhibitory effect of preconditioning with cathodal TDCS was absent. The present data suggest that homeostatic mechanisms that stabilize excitability levels within a useful dynamic range are impaired in patients with writer's cramp. We propose that a faulty homeostatic response to acute increases in corticospinal excitability favours maladaptive motor plasticity. The role of homeostatic-like plasticity in the pathophysiology of task-specific dystonias warrants further study."

Despite recent progress, recovery of motor function after stroke is usually incomplete. This double blind, Sham-controlled, crossover study was designed to test the hypothesis that non-invasive stimulation of the motor cortex could improve motor function in the paretic hand of patients with chronic stroke. Hand function was measured using the Jebsen-Taylor Hand Function Test (JTT), a widely used, well validated test for functional motor assessment that reflects activities of daily living. JTT measured in the paretic hand improved significantly with non-invasive transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), but not with Sham, an effect that outlasted the stimulation period, was present in every single patient tested and that correlated with an increment in motor cortical excitability within the affected hemisphere, expressed as increased recruitment curves (RC) and reduced short-interval intracortical inhibition.

It was found that both cathodal and anodal stimulation over MT+/V5 resulted in a significant reduction of the perceived motion after-effect duration, but had no effect on performance in a luminance-change-detection task used to determine attentional load during adaptation. Our control experiment excluded the possibility that the observed MT+/V5 stimulation effects were due to a diffused modulation of the early cortical areas, i.e. by the stimulation applied over MT+/V5.

Periods rich in slow-wave sleep (SWS) not only facilitate the consolidation of declarative memories, but in humans, SWS is also accompanied by a pronounced endogenous transcortical DC potential shift of negative polarity over frontocortical areas. To experimentally induce widespread extracellular negative DC potentials, we applied anodal tDCS (0.26 mA) [correction] repeatedly (over 30 min) bilaterally at frontocortical electrode sites during a retention period rich in SWS. Retention of declarative memories (word pairs) and also nondeclarative memories (mirror tracing skills) learned previously was tested after this period and compared with retention performance after placebo stimulation as well as after retention intervals of wakefulness. Compared with placebo stimulation, anodal tDCS during SWS-rich sleep distinctly increased the retention of word pairs (p < 0.005). When applied during the wake retention interval, tDCS did not affect declarative memory. Procedural memory was also not affected by tDCS. Mood was improved both after tDCS during sleep and during wake intervals. tDCS increased sleep depth toward the end of the stimulation period, whereas the average power in the faster frequency bands (,alpha, and beta) was reduced. Acutely, anodal tDCS increased slow oscillatory activity <3 Hz. We conclude that effects of tDCS involve enhanced generation of slow oscillatory EEG activity considered to facilitate processes of neuronal plasticity. Shifts in extracellular ionic concentration in frontocortical tissue (expressed as negative DC potentials during SWS) may facilitate sleep-dependent consolidation of declarative memories."

Strong evidence implicates intracortical mechanisms in this depression. As well as evoking MEPs in contralateral muscles, TMS also reduces MEPs evoked in ipsilateral muscles through interhemispheric inhibition mediated by a transcallosal pathway. Here we have sought to determine whether this effect is also depressed after exercise. Using two magnetic stimulators, the aftereffects of unilateral hand muscle exercise on the ability of TMS delivered to the hemisphere that generated the exercise were examined to i) generate MEPs in the exercised hand muscles, and ii) depress MEPs evoked by TMS pulses in contralateral (non-exercised) hand muscles. After exercise there was a significant reduction in the amplitudes of MEPs evoked by TMS in the exercised muscles ( p<0.001). However, the same stimuli remained able to depress responses evoked by TMS to the contralateral hemisphere in the non-exercised muscles as effectively as before the exercise. We conclude that unlike the MEPs evoked by corticospinal output, interhemispheric inhibition evoked from the hemisphere that generated the exercise is not depressed after exercise. A similar differential effect on interhemispheric inhibition and corticospinal output has been reported recently for the effects of transcranial direct current (DC) stimulation of the motor cortex. Fatiguing exercise and transcranial DC stimulation may therefore engage similar intracortical mechanisms."

Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) offers the advantage of portable equipment and could, therefore, be used for ambulatory modulation of brain excitability. However, modulation of cortical excitability by tDCS has so far mostly been shown by indirect measures. Therefore, we examined whether tDCS has a direct behavioral/perceptional effect. We compared tactile discrimination of vibratory stimuli to the left ring finger prior to, during and after tDCS applied for 7 min at 1-mA current intensity in 13 subjects. Stimulation was pseudorandomized into cathodal, anodal and sham conditions in a within-subject design. The active electrode was placed over the corresponding somatosensory cortex at C4 according to the 10-20 EEG system and the reference electrode at the forehead above the contralateral orbita. Cathodal stimulation compared with sham induced a prolonged decrease of tactile discrimination, while anodal and sham stimulation did not. Thus, cortical processing can be modulated in a behaviorally/perceptually meaningful way by weak transcranial current stimulation applied through portable technology. This finding offers a new perspective for the treatment of conditions characterized by alterations of cortical excitability."

We studied the impact of this drug on long-lasting after-effects of transcranial direct current (tDCS)-generated motor cortical excitability shifts, as revealed by transcranial magnetic stimulation-elicited motor-evoked potentials. While anodal tDCS enhances motor cortical excitability, cathodal tDCS diminishes it. Both effects seem to be NMDA receptor dependent. D-CYC selectively potentiated the duration of motor cortical excitability enhancements induced by anodal tDCS. D-CYC alone did not modulate excitability. The potency of this drug to consolidate neuronal excitability enhancements, most probably by stabilizing the strengthening of NMDA receptors, which is a probable neurophysiological derivate of learning processes, makes it an interesting substance to improve cognitive functions."
"Oscillatory brain activity and transcranial direct current stimulation in humans.",Neuroreport,2004,530-6,15,Array,Array,15167555,8,"The aim of this study was to induce changes of the oscillatory activity in the visual cortex of healthy human subjects by modulation of neuronal excitability using weak transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). tDCS is a non-invasive stimulation method which induces prolonged, polarity-dependent increases or reductions in cortical excitability. An increase in high frequency oscillatory activity in the beta and gamma frequency ranges is closely related in time to the N70 peak of the primary visual evoked potential (VEP), which is an early sensory component of visual activation. Therefore this potential can be used to observe tDCS-induced changes related to oscillatory activity. VEPs were recorded using sinusoidal luminance gratings in an on/off mode before, immediately after and 10, 20, 30 min after the end of 10 min anodal or cathodal stimulation. Cathodal stimulation significantly decreased while anodal stimulation slightly increased the normalized beta and gamma frequency powers. We have shown here that tDCS transiently and reversibly changed the organized cortical activity elicited by visual stimulation. Since gamma activity is also related to a higher level of information processing, tDCS might be a suitable method to affect higher order cognitive processes."

Ten minutes after tDCS, MEPs at rest returned to baseline values while MEPs during motor imagery were suppressed for up to 30 min. No changes in MEP amplitude during imagery were found after anodal stimulation. tDCS could represent a powerful tool to modulate the excitability of motor areas involved in mental practice and motor imagery."
"Direct current stimulation over V5 enhances visuomotor coordination by improving motion perception in humans.","Journal of cognitive neuroscience",2004,530-6,16,Array,Array,15165345,4,"The primary aim of this study was to determine the extent to which human MT+/V5, an extrastriate visual area known to mediate motion processing, is involved in visuomotor coordination. To pursue this we increased or decreased the excitability of MT+/V5, primary motor, and primary visual cortex by the application of 7 min of anodal and cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in healthy human subjects while they were performing a visuomotor tracking task involving hand movements. The percentage of correct tracking movements increased specifically during and immediately after cathodal stimulation, which decreases cortical excitability, only when V5 was stimulated. None of the other stimulation conditions affected visuomotor performance. We propose that the improvement in performance caused by cathodal tDCS of V5 is due to a focusing effect on to the complex motion perception conditions involved in this task. This hypothesis was proven by additional experiments: Testing simple and complex motion perception in dot kinetograms, we found that a diminution in excitability induced by cathodal stimulation improved the subject's perception of the direction of the coherent motion only if this was presented among random dots (complex motion perception), and worsened it if only one motion direction was presented (simple movement perception). Our data suggest that area V5 is critically involved in complex motion perception and identification processes important for visuomotor coordination. The results also raise the possibility of the usefulness of tDCS in rehabilitation strategies for neurological patients with visuomotor disorders."

To pursue this, we increased or decreased MT+/V5, primary contralateral motor (M1) and primary visual cortex excitability by 10 min of anodal or cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation in healthy human subjects during the learning phase of a visually guided tracking task. The percentage of correct tracking movements increased significantly in the early learning phase during anodal stimulation, but only when the left V5 or M1 was stimulated. Cathodal stimulation had no significant effect. Also, stimulation of the primary visual cortex was not effective for this kind of task. Our data suggest that the areas V5 and M1 are involved in the early phase of learning of visuo-motor coordination."
"Catecholaminergic consolidation of motor cortical neuroplasticity in humans.","Cerebral cortex (New York, N.Y. : 1991)",2004,530-6,14,Array,Array,15142961,11,"Amphetamine, a catecholaminergic re-uptake-blocker, is able to improve neuroplastic mechanisms in humans. However, so far not much is known about the underlying physiological mechanisms. Here, we study the impact of amphetamine on NMDA receptor-dependent long-lasting excitability modifications in the human motor cortex elicited by weak transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Amphetamine significantly enhanced and prolonged increases in anodal, tDCS-induced, long-lasting excitability. Under amphetamine premedication, anodal tDCS resulted in an enhancement of excitability which lasted until the morning after tDCS, compared to approximately 1 h in the placebo condition. Prolongation of the excitability enhancement was most pronounced for long-term effects; the duration of short-term excitability enhancement was only slightly increased. Since the additional application of the NMDA receptor antagonist dextromethorphane blocked any enhancement of tDCS-driven excitability under amphetamine, we conclude that amphetamine consolidates the tDCS-induced neuroplastic effects, but does not initiate them. The fact that propanolol, a beta-adrenergic antagonist, diminished the duration of the tDCS-generated after-effects suggests that adrenergic receptors play a certain role in the consolidation of NMDA receptor-dependent motor cortical excitability modifications in humans. This result may enable researchers to optimize neuroplastic processes in the human brain on the rational basis of purpose-designed pharmacological interventions."

Case-control, neurophysiological studies in persons with Tourette Syndrome (TS), Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) support this model. To compare the strength of association between motor cortex inhibition and tic, ADHD, and OCD severity in TS, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation to measure motor cortex inhibition in 36 children and adults with TS. Current symptom severity was assessed with standard clinical rating scales and compared with neurophysiological measures using correlational and multivariate regression analyses. Severity of ADHD symptoms and motor tics were associated significantly and independently with short interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) (r(2) = 0.50; F[2,27] = 13.7; P < 0.001), particularly in subjects not taking neuroleptics (r(2) = 0.68; F[2,17] = 17.8; P < 0.0001). The correlation of cortical disinhibition was greater with ADHD symptoms severity (r = 0.53; P = 0.003) than with tic severity (r = 0.42; P = 0.02), suggesting that in TS, the association between SICI and ADHD symptoms may be more consistent or direct than the association between SICI and tics."

Experimentelle Hirnforschung. Expérimentation cérébrale",2004,530-6,155,Array,Array,15064884,1,"Current concepts of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the primary motor cortex are still under debate as to whether inhibitory motor effects are exclusively of cortical origin. To further elucidate a potential subcortical influence on motor effects, we combined TMS and unilateral subcortical electrical stimulation (SES) of the corticospinal tract. SES was performed through implanted depth electrodes in eight patients treated with deep brain stimulation (DBS) for severe dystonia. Chronaxie, conduction velocity (CV) of the stimulated fibres and poststimulus time histograms of single motor unit recordings were calculated to provide evidence of an activation of large diameter myelinated fibres by SES. Excitatory and inhibitory motor effects recorded bilaterally from the first dorsal interosseus muscle were measured after SES and focal TMS of the motor cortex. This allowed us to compare motor effects of subcortical (direct) and cortical (mainly indirect) activation of corticospinal neurons. SES activated a fast conducting monosynaptic pathway to the alpha motoneuron. Motor responses elicited by SES had significantly shorter onset latency and shorter duration of the contralateral silent period compared to TMS induced motor effects. Spinal excitability as assessed by H-reflex was significantly reduced during the silent period after SES. No ipsilateral motor effects could be elicited by SES while TMS was followed by an ipsilateral inhibition. The results suggest that SES activated the corticospinal neurons at the level of the internal capsule. Comparison of SES and TMS induced motor effects reveals that the first part of the TMS induced contralateral silent period should be of spinal origin while its later part is due to cortical inhibitory mechanisms. Furthermore, the present results suggest that the ipsilateral inhibition is predominantly mediated via transcallosal pathways."
"Preconditioning of low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation with transcranial direct current stimulation: evidence for homeostatic plasticity in the human motor cortex.","The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience",2004,3379-85,24,Array,Array,15056717,13,"Recent experimental work in animals has emphasized the importance of homeostatic plasticity as a means of stabilizing the properties of neuronal circuits. Here, we report a phenomenon that indicates a homeostatic pattern of cortical plasticity in healthy human subjects. The experiments combined two techniques that can produce long-term effects on the excitability of corticospinal output neurons: transcranial direct current stimulation (TDCS) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the left primary motor cortex. ""Facilitatory preconditioning"" with anodal TDCS caused a subsequent period of 1 Hz rTMS to reduce corticospinal excitability to below baseline levels for >20 min. Conversely, ""inhibitory preconditioning"" with cathodal TDCS resulted in 1 Hz rTMS increasing corticospinal excitability for at least 20 min. No changes in excitability occurred when 1 Hz rTMS was preceded by sham TDCS. Thus, changing the initial state of the motor cortex by a period of DC polarization reversed the conditioning effects of 1 Hz rTMS. These preconditioning effects of TDCS suggest the existence of a homeostatic mechanism in the human motor cortex that stabilizes corticospinal excitability within a physiologically useful range."
"The antinociceptive effect of transcranial electrostimulation with combined direct and alternating current in freely moving rats.","Anesthesia and analgesia",2004,3379-85,98,Array,Array,14980928,3,"Transcranial electrostimulation (TES) has been reported to elicit significant analgesia, allowing a substantial reduction of intraoperative opioids. Acceptance of TES into clinical practice is hampered by lack of controlled clinical trials and inconclusive animal data regarding the TES antinociceptive action. This inconclusive data may be explained, in part, by failure in rat experiments to simulate the variables used in humans when TES electrodes are positioned on the skin. In this study we validated the TES antinociceptive effect in a novel animal model of cutaneously administered TES, when the stimulating conditions mimic the ones used in clinical practice. The antinociceptive effect was assessed by measuring nociceptive thresholds in the tail-flick and hot-plate latency tests in awake, unrestrained male rats. Data were analyzed by analysis of variance and mixed-effects population modeling. The administration of TES at 2.25 mA produced an almost immediate, sustained, frequency-dependent (40-60 Hz) antinociceptive effect, reaching approximately 50% of the maximal possible value. We conclude that an antinociceptive effect of cutaneously administered TES can be demonstrated in the rat. Some characteristics of the effect suggest an important role of the sensory nerves of the rat's scalp in mediating the TES antinociceptive response."

In the present study we asked whether tDCS applied to the left primary motor cortex (M1) also produces aftereffects distant from the site of the stimulating electrodes. We therefore tested corticospinal excitability in the left and the right M1 and transcallosal excitability between the two cortices using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) before and after applying tDCS. Eight healthy subjects received 10 min of anodal or cathodal tDCS (1 mA) to the left M1. We examined the amplitude of contralateral motor evoked potentials (MEPs) and the onset latency and duration of transcallosal inhibition with single pulse TMS. MEPs evoked from the tDCS stimulated (left) M1 were increased by 32% after anodal and decreased by 27% after cathodal tDCS, while transcallosal inhibition evoked from the left M1 remained unchanged. The effect on MEPs evoked from the left M1 lasted longer for cathodal than for anodal tDCS. MEPs evoked from the right M1 were unchanged whilst the duration of transcallosal inhibition evoked from the right M1 was shortened after cathodal tDCS and prolonged after anodal tDCS. The duration of transcallosal inhibition returned to control values before the effect on the MEPs from the left M1 had recovered. These findings are compatible with the idea that tDCS-induced aftereffects in the cortical motor system are limited to the stimulated hemisphere, and that tDCS not only affects corticospinal circuits involved in producing MEPs but also inhibitory interneurons mediating transcallosal inhibition from the contralateral hemisphere."

In this task subjects learned which of two outcomes would occur on each trial after presentation of a particular combination of cues. Ten minutes of anodal, but not cathodal, stimulation improved implicit learning only when the left PFC was stimulated.

In this study we tested the involvement of V1 in the perception of moving phosphenes by applying transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to this area. tDCS is a non-invasive stimulation technique known to modulate cortical excitability in a polarity-specific manner. Moving and stationary phosphene thresholds (PT) were measured by TMS before, immediately after and 10, 20 and 30 min after the end of 10 min cathodal and anodal tDCS in nine healthy subjects. Reduced PTs were detected immediately and 10 min after the end of anodal tDCS while cathodal stimulation resulted in an opposite effect.

In a first attempt, we performed extracellular single-unit recordings in the primary visual cortex (area 17) of the anaesthetised and paralysed cat, with the stimulating magnetic field centred at the recording site (2 x 70 mm figure-of-eight coil). The effect of single biphasic TMS pulses, which induce a lateral-to-medial electric current within the occipital pole of the right hemisphere, was tested for spontaneous as well as visually evoked activity. For cat visual cortex we found that a single TMS pulse elicited distinct episodes of enhanced and suppressed activity: in general, a facilitation of activity was found during the first 500 ms, followed thereafter by a suppression of activity lasting up to a few seconds. Strong stimuli exceeding 50 % of maximal stimulator output could also lead to an early suppression of activity during the first 100-200 ms, followed by stronger (rebound) facilitation. Early suppression and facilitation of activity may be related to a more or less direct stimulation of inhibitory and excitatory interneurons, probably with different thresholds. The late, long-lasting suppression is more likely to be related to metabotropic or metabolic processes, or even vascular responses. The time course of facilitation/inhibition may provide clues regarding the action of repetitive TMS application."
"Effect of transcranial magnetic stimulation on single-unit activity in the cat primary visual cortex.","The Journal of physiology",2003,113-7,553,Array,Array,12963791,"Pt 2","Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the human motor cortex results in polarity-specific shifts of cortical excitability during and after stimulation. Anodal tDCS enhances and cathodal stimulation reduces excitability. Animal experiments have demonstrated that the effect of anodal tDCS is caused by neuronal depolarisation, while cathodal tDCS hyperpolarises cortical neurones. However, not much is known about the ion channels and receptors involved in these effects. Thus, the impact of the sodium channel blocker carbamazepine, the calcium channel blocker flunarizine and the NMDA receptor antagonist dextromethorphane on tDCS-elicited motor cortical excitability changes of healthy human subjects were tested. tDCS-protocols inducing excitability alterations (1) only during tDCS and (2) eliciting long-lasting after-effects were applied after drug administration. Carbamazepine selectively eliminated the excitability enhancement induced by anodal stimulation during and after tDCS. Flunarizine resulted in similar changes. Antagonising NMDA receptors did not alter current-generated excitability changes during a short stimulation, which elicits no after-effects, but prevented the induction of long-lasting after-effects independent of their direction. These results suggest that, like in other animals, cortical excitability shifts induced during tDCS in humans also depend on membrane polarisation, thus modulating the conductance of sodium and calcium channels. Moreover, they suggest that the after-effects may be NMDA receptor dependent. Since NMDA receptors are involved in neuroplastic changes, the results suggest a possible application of tDCS in the modulation or induction of these processes in a clinical setting. The selective elimination of tDCS-driven excitability enhancements by carbamazepine proposes a role for this drug in focussing the effects of cathodal tDCS, which may have important future clinical applications."

The DC plus ES protocol showed FDI changes that were significant after the second set of stimulation with the elevations persisting when tested 15 and 30 min post intervention. These observations show that a period of anodal DC stimulation preceding a period of ulnar nerve stimulation resulted in significant and persistent elevations in cortical excitability."
"Increased cortical excitability induced by transcranial DC and peripheral nerve stimulation.","Journal of neuroscience methods",2003,113-7,127,Array,Array,9153480,2,"In this review we discuss the contribution of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to the understanding of human motor control. Compound motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) may provide valuable information about corticospinal transmission, especially in patients with neurological disorders, but generally do not allow conclusions regarding the details of corticospinal function to be made. Techniques such as poststimulus time histograms (PSTHs) of the discharge of single, voluntarily activated motor units and conditioning of H reflexes provide a more optimal way of evaluating transmission in specific excitatory and inhibitory pathways. Through application of such techniques, several important issues have been clarified. TMS has provided the first real evidence that direct monosynaptic connections from the motor cortex to spinal motoneurons exist in man, and it has been revealed that the distribution of these projections roughly follows the same proximal-distal gradient as in other primates. However, pronounced differences also exist. In particular, the tibialis anterior muscle appears to receive as significant a monosynaptic corticospinal drive as muscles in the hand. The reason for this may be the importance of this muscle in controlling the foot trajectory in the swing phase of walking. Conditioning of H reflexes by TMS has provided evidence of changes in cortical excitability prior to and during various movements. These experiments have generally confirmed information obtained from chronic recording of the activity of corticospinal cells in primates, but information about the corticospinal contribution to movements for which information from other primates is sparse or lacking has also been obtained. One example is walking, where TMS experiments have revealed that the corticospinal tract makes an important contribution to the ongoing EMG activity during treadmill walking. TMS experiments have also documented the convergence of descending corticospinal projections and peripheral afferents on spinal interneurons. Current investigations of the functional significance of this convergence also rely on TMS experiments. The general conclusion from this review is that TMS is a powerful technique in the analysis of motor control, but that care is necessary when interpreting the data. Combining TMS with other techniques such as PSTH and H reflex testing amplifies greatly the power of the technique."

DCs delivered at relatively strong intensities (1 mA) and for long periods (10 min or so), not only influence (either increase or decrease) brain excitability during their application in normal subjects, but induce persistent changes in excitability after their offset that, at least in the motor cortex, can last for almost 1 h.

"Corticospinal volleys evoked by transcranial stimulation of the brain in conscious humans.","Neurological research",2003,589-95,25,Array,Array,12635512,2,"The direct recording in conscious humans of corticospinal volleys evoked by different magnetic and electric techniques of transcranial stimulation demonstrates that it is possible to activate neurones of the motor cortex in several different ways. Lateral electrical stimulation of the motor cortex preferentially activates the axons of corticospinal neurones in the subcortical white matter, and evokes a D-wave in pyramidal tract. The way of activation of corticospinal neurones using magnetic stimulation depends on the direction of the electrical current induced in the brain and on the shape of the coil. Monophasic magnetic stimulation with a focal figure-of-eight coil inducing posterior-anterior current in the brain activates corticospinal neurones trans-synaptically recruiting an 11-wave, with later I-waves appearing in sequence at higher intensities and a D-wave at very high intensities. If the induced current is rotated to the anterior-posterior direction late I-waves are preferentially recruited and when a D-wave is recruited, it has a later onset than the electrical D-wave, suggesting an activation nearer the cell body of the pyramidal neurones. A latero-medial induced current activates both corticospinal axons at the same point as electrical stimulation evoking a D wave and cortico-cortical axons evoking I-waves. A nonfocal large circular coil centered at the vertex is capable of activating pyramidal neurones both at the initial segment and trans-synaptically evoking a D wave with a longer latency than the electrical D-wave and I-waves. Using a biphasic magnetic stimulation, both phases of the biphasic pulse are capable of activating descending motor output and the pattern of recruitment of descending activity depends on the intensity of the stimulus and the relative threshold of each volley to each direction of current flow."

It encompasses two widely used waveform configurations: mono-phasic magnetic pulses induce a single current in the brain while biphasic pulses induce at least two currents of inverse direction. As has been shown for the motor cortex, efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) may depend on pulse configuration. In order to clarify this question with regard to visual perception, static contrast sensitivities (sCS) were evaluated before, during, immediately after and 10 minutes after monophasic and biphasic low frequency (1 Hz) rTMS applied to the occipital cortex of 15 healthy subjects. The intensity of stimulation was the phosphene threshold of each individual subject. Using 4 c/d spatial frequency, significant sCS loss was found during and immediately after 10 min of monophasic stimulation, while biphasic stimulation resulted in no significant effect. Ten minutes after the end of stimulation, the sCS values were at baseline level again. However, reversed current flow direction resulted in an increased efficacy of biphasic and decreased efficacy of monophasic stimulation. Our results are in agreement with previous findings showing that primary visual functions, such as contrast detection, can be transiently altered by low frequency transcranial magnetic stimulation. However the effect of modulation significantly depends on the current waveform and direction."
"Transcranial direct current stimulation: a new treatment for depression?","Bipolar disorders",2002,589-95,"4 Suppl 1",Array,Array,12479691,,"Over the past 20 years, new methods have been developed that have allowed scientists to visualize the human brain in action. Initially positron emission tomography (PET) and now functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are causing a paradigm shift in psychiatry and the neurosciences. Psychiatry is abandoning the pharmacological model of 'brain as soup', used for much of the past 20 years. Instead, there is new realization that both normal and abnormal behavior arise from chemical processes that occur within parallel distributed networks in specific brain regions. Many of these pathological circuits are becoming well characterized, in disorders ranging from Parkinson's disease, to obsessive-compulsive disorder, to depression. Most recently, there has been an explosion of new techniques that allow for direct stimulation of these brain circuits, without the need for open craniotomy and neurosurgical ablation. The techniques include transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), magnetic seizure therapy (MST), vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), and deep brain stimulation (DBS). This review will describe these new tools, and overview their current and future potential for research and clinical neuropsychiatric use. The psychiatry of the future will be better grounded in a firm understanding of neuroanatomy and neurophysiology (as well as pharmacology). These brain stimulation tools, or their next iterations, will play an ever-larger role in clinical neuropsychiatric practice."

These plastic excitability changes are selectively controlled by the polarity, duration and current strength of stimulation. To reveal the underlying mechanisms of direct current (DC)-induced neuroplasticity, we combined tDCS of the motor cortex with the application of Na(+)-channel-blocking carbamazepine (CBZ) and the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-receptor antagonist dextromethorphan (DMO). Monitored by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), motor cortical excitability changes of up to 40% were achieved in the drug-free condition. Increase of cortical excitability could be selected by anodal stimulation, and decrease by cathodal stimulation. Both types of excitability change lasted several minutes after cessation of current stimulation. DMO suppressed the post-stimulation effects of both anodal and cathodal DC stimulation, strongly suggesting the involvement of NMDA receptors in both types of DC-induced neuroplasticity. In contrast, CBZ selectively eliminated anodal effects. Since CBZ stabilizes the membrane potential voltage-dependently, the results reveal that after-effects of anodal tDCS require a depolarization of membrane potentials. Similar to the induction of established types of short- or long-term neuroplasticity, a combination of glutamatergic and membrane mechanisms is necessary to induce the after-effects of tDCS. On the basis of these results, we suggest that polarity-driven alterations of resting membrane potentials represent the crucial mechanisms of the DC-induced after-effects, leading to both an alteration of spontaneous discharge rates and to a change in NMDA-receptor activation."
"Pharmacological approach to the mechanisms of transcranial DC-stimulation-induced after-effects of human motor cortex excitability.","Brain : a journal of neurology",2002,589-95,125,Array,Array,12244081,"Pt 10","Modulation of cerebral excitability is thought to be one mechanism underlying the pharmacological treatment of neuropsychiatric diseases such as epilepsy, depression, and dystonia. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been tested for several years as a nonpharmacological, noninvasive method of directly influencing patients' cortical functions. We present an overview of the more easily performed transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) with weak current, which produces distinctly more pronounced changes in excitability than rTMS. The basic underlying mechanism is a shift in the resting membrane potential towards either hyper- or depolarisation, depending on stimulation polarity. This in turn leads to changes in the excitability of cortical neurons. Anodic stimulation increases cortical excitability, while cathodic stimulation decreases it. These changes persist after the end of stimulation if the stimulation lasts long enough, i.e., at least several minutes. The duration of this aftereffect can be controlled through the duration and intensity of the stimulation. Transcranial direct current stimulation essentially allows a focal, selective, reversible, pain-free, and noninvasive induction of changes in cortical excitability, the therapeutic potential of which must be evaluated in clinical studies, once possible risk factors have been assessed."

"Investigation into non-monosynaptic corticospinal excitation of macaque upper limb single motor units.","Journal of neurophysiology",2001,1899-901,86,Array,Array,11600621,4,"There has been considerable recent debate as to relative importance, in the primate, of propriospinal transmission of corticospinal excitation to upper limb motoneurons. Previous studies in the anesthetized macaque monkey suggested that, compared with the cat, the transmission of such excitation via a system of C3-C4 propriospinal neurons may be relatively weak. However, it is possible that in the anesthetized preparation, propriospinal transmission of cortical inputs to motoneurons may be depressed. To address this issue, the current study investigated the responses of single motor units (SMUs) to corticospinal inputs in either awake (n = 1) or lightly sedated (n = 3) macaque monkeys. Recordings in the awake state were made during performance of a precision grip task. The responses of spontaneously discharging SMUs to electrical stimulation of the pyramidal tract (PT) via chronically implanted electrodes were examined for evidence of non-monosynaptic, presumed propriospinal, effects. Single PT stimuli (up to 250 microA; duration, 0.2 ms, 2 Hz) were delivered during steady discharge of the SMU (10-30 imp/s). SMUs were recorded from muscles acting on the thumb (adductor pollicis and abductor pollicis brevis, n = 18), wrist (extensor carpi radialis, n = 29) and elbow (biceps, n = 9). In all SMUs, the poststimulus time histograms to PT stimulation consisted of a single peak at a fixed latency and with a brief duration [0.74 +/- 0.25 (SD) ms, n = 56], consistent with the responses being mediated by monosynaptic action of cortico-motoneuronal (CM) impulses. Later peaks, indicating non-monosynaptic action, were not present even when the probability of the initial peak response was low and when there was no evidence for suppression of ongoing SMU activity following this peak (n = 20 SMUs). Even when repetitive (double-pulse) PT stimuli were used to facilitate transmission through oligosynaptic linkages, no later peaks were observed (16 SMUs). In some thumb muscle SMUs (n = 8), responses to PT stimulation were compared with those evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation, using a figure-eight coil held over the motor cortex. Responses varied according the orientation of the coil: in the latero-medial position, single peak responses similar to those from the PT were obtained; their latencies confirmed direct excitation of CM cells, and there were no later peaks. In the posterio-anterior orientation, responses had longer latencies and consisted of two to three subpeaks. At least under the conditions that we have tested, the results provide no positive evidence for transmission of cortical excitation to upper limb motoneurons by non-monosynaptic pathways in the macaque monkey."

Activation maps for a right hand sequential finger opposition task were obtained for six subjects before as well as 0-5 min and 15-20 min after a 5-min period of 1 mA cathodal and, in a separate session, anodal tDCS of the left-hemispheric motor cortex. Cathodal tDCS resulted in a global decrease of the mean number of activated pixels by 38% (P < 0.01) 0-5 min after stimulation, which reduced to 28% (P < 0.05) 15-20 min after stimulation. A region-of-interest analysis revealed a 57% decrease of activated pixels (P < 0.001) in the supplementary motor area, but no change in the hand area of the primary motor cortex. Anodal tDCS yielded a nonsignificant 5% increase of activated pixels with no regional differences. These findings support the view that reduced neuroaxonal excitability after cathodal tDCS causes reduced brain activity. However, rather than affecting the primary sensorimotor input of an active task, the process appears to dampen those responses that rely on cortico-cortical connections and related processing.

We studied the influence of tDCS, applied over the motorcortex during training, on angular deviation of post-training to pre-training TMS-evoked thumb movements. With tDCS of anodal and cathodal polarity the training-induced directional change of thumb movements was significantly reduced during a 10 min post-training interval, indicating an interference of tDCS with mechanisms of rapid training-induced plasticity."
"Excitability changes induced in the human motor cortex by weak transcranial direct current stimulation.","The Journal of physiology",2000,1899-901,"527 Pt 3",Array,Array,10990547,,"In this paper we demonstrate in the intact human the possibility of a non-invasive modulation of motor cortex excitability by the application of weak direct current through the scalp. Excitability changes of up to 40 %, revealed by transcranial magnetic stimulation, were accomplished and lasted for several minutes after the end of current stimulation. Excitation could be achieved selectively by anodal stimulation, and inhibition by cathodal stimulation. By varying the current intensity and duration, the strength and duration of the after-effects could be controlled. The effects were probably induced by modification of membrane polarisation. Functional alterations related to post-tetanic potentiation, short-term potentiation and processes similar to postexcitatory central inhibition are the likely candidates for the excitability changes after the end of stimulation. Transcranial electrical stimulation using weak current may thus be a promising tool to modulate cerebral excitability in a non-invasive, painless, reversible, selective and focal way."

The current fads resemble those at the end of the last century, when many were falsely touting the benefits of direct electrical and weak magnetic stimulation. Yet in the midst of this popular interest in magnetic therapy, a new neuroscience field has developed that uses powerful magnetic fields to alter brain activity--transcranial magnetic stimulation. This review examines the basic principles underlying transcranial magnetic stimulation, and describes how it differs from electrical stimulation or other uses of magnets. Initial studies in this field are critically summarized, particularly as they pertain to the pathophysiology and treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. Transcranial magnetic stimulation is a promising new research and, perhaps, therapeutic tool, but more work remains before it can be fully integrated in psychiatry's diagnostic and therapeutic armamentarium."
"The first component of polyphasic motor evoked potentials is resistant to suppression by paired transcranial magnetic stimulation in humans.","Journal of the neurological sciences",1998,1899-901,159,Array,Array,5966424,2,"The suppressive effect of paired transcranial magnetic stimulation on the different components of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) from the left first dorsal interosseous muscle (FDI) was investigated in ten healthy human subjects.

The threshold stimulus intensity of the minimally contracted FDI was determined with each coil. The stimulus intensities of conditioning and test stimuli were 80% and 130-140% of the threshold intensity, respectively. The coil current direction at the intersection of the figure-eight coil was medio-lateral. The coil position for test stimuli was adjusted to evoke discretely polyphasic MEPs in the contracted FDI. Conditioning stimuli were followed by test stimuli at intervals of 1-10, and 15 ms. When the interstimulus intervals were less than 5 ms, the second negative phase of MEPs was suppressed compared to that of the unconditioned responses, whereas the first phase was not suppressed. The present results imply that the first phase reflects direct corticospinal volleys, which are resistant to cortico-cortical inhibition."
"Interaction between intracortical inhibition and facilitation in human motor cortex.","The Journal of physiology",1996,1899-901,"496 ( Pt 3)",Array,Array,5684882,,"1. In seven normal subjects, subthreshold transcranial magnetic conditioning stimuli (using a figure-of-eight coil) were applied over the motor cortex in order to evoke activity in intracortical neuronal circuits. The net effect on cortical excitability was evaluated by measuring the effect on the size of EMG responses elicited in the abductor digiti minimi (ADM) muscle by a subsequent suprathreshold test stimulus. 2. A single conditioning stimulus suppressed the size of the test response at interstimulus intervals (ISIs) of 1-4 ms whereas the response was facilitated at ISIs of 6-20 ms. The facilitation could be augmented if pairs of conditioning stimuli were given. 3. Inhibition and facilitation appeared to have separate mechanisms. The threshold for inhibition (0.7 active motor threshold) was slightly lower than that for facilitation (0.8 active threshold). Similarly, the inhibitory effect was independent of the direction of current flow induced in the cortex by the conditioning shock, whereas facilitation was maximal with posterior-anterior currents and minimal with lateromedial current. 4. Direct corticospinal effects were probably not responsible for the results since facilitation of cortical test responses could be produced by conditioning stimuli which had no effect on the amplitude of H reflexes elicited in active ADM muscle. 5. Inhibition and facilitation appeared to interact in a roughly linear manner, consistent with separate inputs to a common neurone. 6. We suggest that subthreshold transcranial magnetic stimulation is capable of activating separate populations of excitatory and inhibitory interneurones in the motor cortex."

For electrical stimulation, the anode was placed 7 cm lateral to the vertex and cathode at the vertex (anodal stimulation). The P-A stimulation that was generally used preferentially evoked I waves, whereas the L-M and anodal stimulation preferentially evoked D wave. The results suggested that the mode of activation by transcranial magnetic stimulation altered, depending on its current direction, and the difference between P-M magnetic and electrical stimulation can be explained by the context of the D and I hypothesis."
"[Intracranial blood flow parameters in cerebral functional changes and cognitive cerebral performance].","Der Nervenarzt",1996,1899-901,67,Array,Array,1120172,4,"Extensive studies have revealed a close relationship between neuronal activity and regional cerebral blood flow. However, SPECT and PET, the technologies most commonly used in these studies, are of limited value for assessment of the dynamics of cerebral blood flow changes at different states of functional brain activity. The introduction of transcranial Doppler sonography and the extended application of stimuli presentation and perception have now been added to the investigator's armamentarium. Simple sensory stimulation (visual, acoustic and tactile) and complex mental tasks (viewing of complex pictures, tactile differentiation of objects) changed the blood flow velocity in the basal intracranial arteries. These changes corresponded to the current concepts of functional cortical organization. The magnitude of the flow velocity increases upon visual stimulation was dependent on the complexity of the stimuli used, and was up to 38% in our studies. The introduction of continuous and bilateral simultaneous Doppler recordings, the calculation of mean flow velocity from cardiac cycle to cardiac cycle and a specially designed averaging method for data analysis allowed effective elimination of non-specific influences and made it possible to demonstrate rapid changes of perfusion in both middle cerebral artery territories in direct response to hemisphere-specific tasks. These changes were correlated with known functional cerebral asymmetries. A language task, for instance, was associated with a significantly larger flow velocity increase in the middle cerebral artery of the dominant hemisphere than in the corresponding artery of the non-dominant hemisphere (5.2 +/- 1,8% vs 3.0 +/- 1.8%, p < 0.001). The excellent time resolution of this technology made it possible to record hemodynamic changes taking place in response to modifications of neuronal activity within less than 1 s. The shortest time interval between stimulus presentation and the first significant increase in flow velocity was on average 717 +/- 191 ms. The latency of less than 1 s suggest that the coupling between alterations of neuronal activity and the regional cerebral blood flow response is mediated by an remarkably rapid mechanism."

A volley evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the motor cortex was recorded from the medullary pyramid in an awake monkey performing a precision grip task. It was identified as corticospinal using a collision test. 2. The volley latency was 0.50 ms, indicating that it was produced by direct activation of corticospinal neurones. 3. A mean modulation of 13% in the amplitude of this volley was seen during task performance, with the largest volley occurring during the hold phase of the task. A similar pattern of modulation was seen in the EMG responses of hand and forearm muscles to TMS. 4. No comparable modulation was observed in a volley evoked by electrical stimulation of the corticospinal fibres via chronically implanted electrodes in the cerebral peduncle. 5. The results are compatible with direct activation of the corticospinal neurones by TMS at a site close to the soma, with the probability of activation by TMS depending on the current level of cortical excitability."

Three types of coils: a large figure-eight coil, small figure-eight coil, and a round coil were used. Surface electromyographic activities were recorded from the left tibialis anterior muscle, and the latencies and amplitudes compared with those obtained by anodal electrical stimulation. The most stable responses were obtained when the large figure-eight coil was centered over the vertex and backward current was run through it or when the round coil was centered two to three centimeters anterior to the vertex with left-flowing current in it at the posterior widening. The latencies obtained under these stimulation conditions were the same as those obtained by electrical stimulation.

Magnetic stimulation used a monophasic current pulse through a circular coil centred 3 cm anterior to the vertex. Lowest threshold magnetic stimulation occurred when the current in the coil flowed from the left to the right side at the posterior rim of the coil. Such stimulation produced single unit and surface EMG responses which had the same latency as those produced by anodal electric stimulation. If the direction of the magnetic stimulating current was reversed, response latencies became more variable from unit to unit, and on average they occurred 1.0 +/- 0.5 msec later. In single motor units anodal and magnetic post-stimulus time histogram (PSTH) peaks had the same duration. This was similar to the duration of the PSTH peaks produced by a single low intensity stimulus given to the common peroneal nerve. We conclude that magnetic stimulation can produce direct activation of corticospinal neurones to the tibialis anterior if the direction of induced current flow is optimal. This projection is likely to be either monosynaptic or oligosynaptic."

Five different tissue types were incorporated into the model based on conductivities taken from the literature. The boundary value problem derived from Laplace's equation was solved with a quasi-static approximation. Transcranial electrical stimulation with scalp electrodes was poorly focussed and required high levels of current for stimulation of the cortex. Direct cortical stimulation with bipolar (adjacent) electrodes was found to be very effective in producing localized current flows. Unipolar cortical stimulation (with a more distant reference electrode) produced higher current densities at the same stimulating current as did bipolar stimulation, but stimulated a larger region of the cortex. With the simulated electrodes resting on the pia-arachnoid, as usually occurs clinically, there was significant shunting of the current (7/8 of the total current) through the CSF. Possible changes in electrodes and stimulation parameters that might improve stimulation procedures are considered."

Measurements of latencies of the nasalis muscle response, obtained while the stimulating coil was placed over the parieto-occipital area of the scalp, indicated that it was the labryinthine segment of the facial canal, 5 to 16 mm distal to the CPA, that was activated. This would be in agreement with studies of physical models reported in the literature that showed (a) the strength of the electrical current generated by a magnetic field is particularly high close to a nerve foramen; and (b) excitation to magStim is most likely to occur where the induced electrical field changes rapidly over distance, i.e., at anatomical boundaries between media of high and low specific resistance. These characteristics are found at the end of the labyrinthine segment of the facial canal, where the facial nerve leaves the low-resistance cerebrospinal fluid and enters the high-resistance petrous bone. The site of neural excitation is robust and unaffected by stimulus intensity and current direction within a wide range, or by large changes in location of the coil.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"Physiological studies of electric and magnetic stimulation of the human brain.","Electroencephalography and clinical neurophysiology. Supplement",1991,795-801,43,Array,Array,3079553,,"It is suggested that transcranial electric stimulation can activate pyramidal tract projections both directly and indirectly in a manner similar to that described after direct stimulation of the exposed cortex in the monkey. This produces both D- and I-waves in the pyramidal tract. At high intensities of stimulation, the stimulus can spread into the brain and activate pyramidal tract axons several centimeters below the cortical surface. Magnetic stimulation at moderate intensities produces electromyographic (EMG) responses with latencies 1-2 msec longer than those after electric stimulation. Two possible explanations have been put forward to account for this effect: (1) because of the difference in the direction of electric current flow induced in the brain by the 2 forms of stimulation, magnetic stimulation preferentially excites pyramidal tract cells indirectly, and hence evokes only I-waves in the pyramidal tract. (2) Electric stimulation (even at threshold) activates pyramidal axons deep in the white matter, whereas magnetic stimulation activates the pyramidal cells in the gray matter, probably at their initial segment. There is one interesting consequence common to both explanations. Whether magnetic stimulation activates the pyramidal neurons transsynaptically or at their initial segment, the size of the descending volley evoked will depend on the level of excitability of the motor cortex. In contrast, the response to electric stimulation will be less affected, since a proportion of the descending volley is initiated directly at the axon of the pyramidal cell. This differential effect of cortical excitability on the responses to electrical and magnetic stimulation can be useful in describing excitatory or inhibitory influences on motor cortex from other structures."

Both electrical (with the anode overlying the face area of the motor cortex) and magnetic TCS (with the coil at the vertex) excite the upper motoneurons projecting to the trigeminal motor nucleus, evoking motor potentials (C-MEPs) in the jaw-closing and suprahyoid muscles, but only during voluntary contraction. At least 30% of jaw-closing motoneurons are reached by direct fast-conducting corticobulbar fibres; these projections are mainly crossed. Suprahyoid motoneurons are also reached by fast-conducting corticobulbar fibres; these projections are probably bilateral. In the masseter, electrical TCS also evokes an ipsilateral motor response (R-MEP), followed by a later wave (U), and bilateral inhibitory periods. The R-MEP is secondary to excitation of the motor trigeminal root; the U wave probably results from the simultaneous excitation of Ia afferents in the root and ipsilaterally projecting corticofugal fibres; the inhibitory periods are largely due to activation of exteroceptive afferents in the root. Magnetic TCS, avoiding spread of current to the trigeminal root, evokes C-MEPs but not R-MEPs or U waves. The masseter inhibitory period after magnetic TCS may be due to excitation of corticofugal inhibitory fibres and to mechanical activation of Golgi tendon organs."
"Effect of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) during complex whole body motor skill learning.","Neuroscience letters",2013,76-80,552,Array,Array,23933205,,"The aim of the study was to investigate tDCS effects on motor skill learning in a complex whole body dynamic balance task (DBT). We hypothesized that tDCS over the supplementary motor area (SMA), a region that is known to be involved in the control of multi-joint whole body movements, will result in polarity specific changes in DBT learning. In a randomized sham-controlled, double-blinded parallel design, we applied 20 min of tDCS over the supplementary motor area (SMA) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) while subjects performed a DBT. Anodal tDCS over SMA with the cathode placed over contralateral PFC impaired motor skill learning of the DBT compared to sham. This effect was still present on the second day of training. Reversing the polarity (cathode over SMA, anode over PFC) did not affect motor skill learning neither on the first nor on the second day of training. To better disentangle whether the impaired motor skill learning was due to a modulation of SMA or PFC, we performed an additional control experiment. Here, we applied anodal tDCS over SMA together with a larger and presumably more ineffective electrode (cathode) over PFC. Interestingly this alternative tDCS electrode setup did not affect the outcome of DBT learning. Our results provide novel evidence that a modulation of the (right) PFC seems to impair complex multi-joint motor skill learning. Hence, future studies should take the positioning of both tDCS electrodes into account when investigating complex motor skill learning."
"Battery powered thought: Enhancement of attention, learning, and memory in healthy adults using transcranial direct current stimulation.",NeuroImage,2013,76-80,,Array,Array,23933040,,"This article reviews studies demonstrating enhancement with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of attention, learning, and memory processes in healthy adults. Given that these are fundamental cognitive functions, they may also mediate stimulation effects on other higher-order processes such as decision-making and problem solving. Although tDCS research is still young, there have been a variety of methods used and cognitive processes tested. While these different methods have resulted in seemingly contradictory results among studies, many consistent and noteworthy effects of tDCS on attention, learning, and memory have been reported. The literature suggests that although tDCS as typically applied may not be as useful for localization of function in the brain as some other methods of brain stimulation, tDCS may be particularly well-suited for practical applications involving the enhancement of attention, learning, and memory, in both healthy subjects and in clinical populations."
"Transcranial direct-current stimulation reduced the excitability of diaphragmatic corticospinal pathways whatever the polarity used.","Respiratory physiology & neurobiology",2013,76-80,189,Array,Array,23933029,1,"We investigated effects of transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) on the diaphragmatic corticospinal pathways in healthy human. Anodal, cathodal, and sham tDCS were randomly applied upon the left diaphragmatic motor cortex in twelve healthy right-handed men. Corticospinal pathways excitability was assessed by means of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) elicited motor-evoked-potential (MEP). For each tDCS condition, MEPs were recorded before (Pre) tDCS then after 10 min (Post1, at tDCS discontinuation in the anodal and cathodal sessions) and 20 min (Post2). As result, both anodal and cathodal tDCS significantly decreased MEP amplitude of the right hemidiaphragm at both Post1 and Post2, versus Pre. MEP amplitude was unchanged versus Pre during the sham condition. The effects of cathodal and anodal tDCS applied to the diaphragm motor cortex differ from those observed during tDCS of the limb motor cortex. These differences may be related to specific characteristics of the diaphragmatic corticospinal pathways as well as to the diaphragm's functional peculiarities compared with the limb muscles."
"Long-term analgesic effects of transcranial direct current stimulation of the motor cortex on phantom limb and stump pain: a case report.","Journal of pain and symptom management",2013,76-80,46,Array,Array,23932177,4,"Several studies have already shown that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a useful tool for enhancing recovery in aphasia. However, all tDCS studies have previously investigated the effects using unihemisperic stimulation. No reports to date have examined the role of bihemispheric tDCS on aphasia recovery. Here, eight aphasic persons with apraxia of speech underwent intensive language therapy in two different conditions: real bihemispheric anodic ipsilesional stimulation over the left Broca's area and cathodic contralesional stimulation over the right homologue of Broca's area, and a sham condition. In both conditions, patients underwent concurrent language therapy for their apraxia of speech. The language treatment lasted 10 days (Monday to Friday, then weekend off, then Monday to Friday). There was a 14-day intersession interval between the real and the sham conditions. In all patients, language measures were collected before (T0), at the end of (T10) and 1 week after the end of (F/U) treatment. Results showed that after simultaneous excitatory stimulation to the left frontal hemisphere and inhibitory stimulation to the right frontal hemisphere regions, patients exhibited a significant recovery not only in terms of better accuracy and speed in articulating the treated stimuli but also in other language tasks (picture description, noun and verb naming, word repetition, word reading) which persisted in the follow-up session. Taken together, these data suggest that bihemispheric anodic ipsilesional and cathodic contralesional stimulation in chronic aphasia patients may affect the treated function, resulting in a positive influence on different language tasks."

Non-invasive neurostimulation techniques were restricted to repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS). A total of 17 eligible studies were identified. Random effects analysis revealed a pooled standardized effect size (Hedge's g) of 0.476 (CI: 0.316-0.636), indicating a medium effect size favouring active non-invasive neurostimulation over sham stimulation in the reduction of craving (z=5.832, p<0.001). No significant differences were found between rTMS and tDCS, between the various substances of abuse and between substances of abuse and food, or between left and right DLPFC stimulation. In conclusion, this meta-analysis provides the first clear evidence that non-invasive neurostimulation of the DLPFC decreases craving levels in substance dependence."

High-density electroencephalography was used to define the spatial diffusion of tDCS after effects. Ten healthy subjects performed a finger tapping task with the right hand before and after three separate sessions of 20 minutes of Sham, AtDCS or CtDCS over left primary motor cortex (M1). During movement, we found an increment of low alpha band Event-Related Desynchronization (ERD) in bilateral central, frontal areas and in the left inferior parietal region, as well as an increment of beta ERD in fronto-central and parieto-occipital regions, after AtDCs compared to Sham and CtDCS. In the rest pre-movement period, after Sham as well as AtDCS, we documented an increment of low alpha band power over the course of pre- and post-stimulation recording sessions, localized in the sensorimotor and parieto-occipital regions. On the contrary, after CtDCS no increment of low alpha power was found. Finally beta band coherence among signals from left sensorimotor cortex and activity of bilateral parietal, occipital and right frontal regions was higher after AtDCS compared with Sham condition. Similarly, theta coherence with parietal and frontal regions was enhanced after AtDCS. We hypothesize that the local modulation of membrane polarization, as well as long-lasting synaptic modification induced by tDCS over M1, could result in changes of both local band power and functional architecture of the motor network.

"Local and remote effects of transcranial direct current stimulation on the electrical activity of the motor cortical network.","Human brain mapping",2013,76-80,,Array,Array,23913800,,"Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) was used in 17 normal individuals to modulate vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) and self-motion perception rotational thresholds. The electrodes were applied over the temporoparietal junction bilaterally. Both vestibular nystagmic and perceptual thresholds were increased during as well as after tDCS stimulation. Body rotation was labeled as ipsilateral or contralateral to the anode side, but no difference was observed depending on the direction of rotation or hemisphere polarity. Threshold increase during tDCS was greater for VOR than for motion perception. 'Sham' stimulation had no effect on thresholds. We conclude that tDCS produces an immediate and sustained depression of cortical regions controlling VOR and movement perception. Temporoparietal areas appear to be involved in vestibular threshold modulation but the differential effects observed between VOR and perception suggest a partial dissociation between cortical processing of reflexive and perceptual responses."

The advantages and disadvantages of the electrical and the magnetic stimulating modalities are assessed. The increased latency produced by magnetic as opposed to electrical stimulation is considered.

Existing evoked potentials monitor one or another sensory modality, but no generally usable motor monitor exists. We have reported a motor evoked potential using direct stimulation of the spinal cord over the motor tracts in cats and in humans. To achieve a less invasive monitor, we used transcranial stimulation over the motor cortex in the cat, thus stimulating the motor cortex. We report here the initial application of this method to humans. A plate electrode over the motor cortex on the scalp and a second electrode on the palate direct a mild current through the motor cortex which will activate the motor pathways. This signal can be recorded over the spinal cord. It can elicit contralateral peripheral nerve and electromyographic signals in the limbs or movements when the appropriate stimulation parameters are used. In clinical use to date, this has been more reliable than the somatosensory evoked potential in predicting motor function in patients where the two tests differed. It offers a number of possibilities for the development of valuable brain and spinal cord monitoring techniques, but requires further animal studies and clinical experience. Studies to date have not demonstrated adverse effects, but evaluation is continuing."

"An image-guided transcranial direct current stimulation system: a pilot phantom study.","Physiological measurement",2013,937-50,34,Array,Array,23897099,8,"In this study, an image-guided transcranial direct current stimulation (IG-tDCS) system that can deliver an increased stimulation current to a target brain area without the need to adjust the location of an active electrode was implemented. This IG-tDCS system was based on the array-type tDCS concept, which was validated through computer simulations in a previous study. Unlike a previous study, the present IG-tDCS system adopts a single reference electrode and an active electrode array consisting of 16 (4 × 4) sub-electrodes. The proposed IG-tDCS system is capable of shaping current flow inside the human head by controlling the input currents of the arrayed electrodes. Once a target brain area has been selected, the optimal injection current of each arrayed sub-electrode is evaluated automatically using a genetic algorithm in order to deliver the maximum available current to the target area. The operation of our pilot system was confirmed through a simple phantom experiment."
"Noninvasive transcranial direct current stimulation over the left prefrontal cortex facilitates cognitive flexibility in tool use.","Cognitive neuroscience",2013,937-50,4,Array,Array,23894253,2,"Recent neuroscience evidence suggests that some higher-order tasks might benefit from a reduction in sensory filtering associated with low levels of cognitive control. Guided by neuroimaging findings, we hypothesized that cathodal (inhibitory) transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) will facilitate performance in a flexible use generation task. Participants saw pictures of artifacts and generated aloud either the object’s common use or an uncommon use for it, while receiving cathodal tDCS (1.5 mA) either over left or right PFC, or sham stimulation. A forward digit span task served as a negative control for potential general effects of stimulation. Analysis of voice-onset reaction times and number of responses generated showed significant facilitative effects of left PFC stimulation for the uncommon, but not the common use generation task and no effects of stimulation on the control task. The results support the hypothesis that certain tasks may benefit from a state of diminished cognitive control."
"The pathophysiology of essential tremor and Parkinson's tremor.","Current neurology and neuroscience reports",2013,937-50,13,Array,Array,23893097,9,"We review recent evidence about the pathophysiology of essential tremor and tremor in Parkinson's disease. We believe that a network perspective is necessary to understand this common neurological symptom, and that knowledge of cerebral network dysfunction in tremor disorders will help to develop new therapies. Both essential tremor and Parkinson's tremor are associated with increased activity in the cerebellothalamocortical circuit. However, different pathophysiological mechanisms lead to tremulous activity within this circuit. In Parkinson's disease, evidence suggests that dopaminergic dysfunction of the pallidum triggers increased activity in the cerebellothalamocortical circuit. In essential tremor, GABAergic dysfunction of the cerebellar dentate nucleus and brain stem, possibly caused by neurodegeneration in these regions, may lead to tremulous activity within the cerebellothalamocortical circuit. In both disorders, network parameters such as the strength and directionality of interregional coupling are crucially altered. Exciting new research uses these network parameters to develop network-based therapies, such as closed-loop deep brain stimulation and transcranial magnetic or direct current stimulation."
"Technique and considerations in the use of 4x1 ring high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS).","Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE",2013,937-50,,Array,Array,23893039,77,"High-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) has recently been developed as a noninvasive brain stimulation approach that increases the accuracy of current delivery to the brain by using arrays of smaller ""high-definition"" electrodes, instead of the larger pad-electrodes of conventional tDCS. Targeting is achieved by energizing electrodes placed in predetermined configurations. One of these is the 4x1-ring configuration. In this approach, a center ring electrode (anode or cathode) overlying the target cortical region is surrounded by four return electrodes, which help circumscribe the area of stimulation. Delivery of 4x1-ring HD-tDCS is capable of inducing significant neurophysiological and clinical effects in both healthy subjects and patients. Furthermore, its tolerability is supported by studies using intensities as high as 2.0 milliamperes for up to twenty minutes. Even though 4x1 HD-tDCS is simple to perform, correct electrode positioning is important in order to accurately stimulate target cortical regions and exert its neuromodulatory effects. The use of electrodes and hardware that have specifically been tested for HD-tDCS is critical for safety and tolerability. Given that most published studies on 4x1 HD-tDCS have targeted the primary motor cortex (M1), particularly for pain-related outcomes, the purpose of this article is to systematically describe its use for M1 stimulation, as well as the considerations to be taken for safe and effective stimulation. However, the methods outlined here can be adapted for other HD-tDCS configurations and cortical targets."
"Behavioral effects of transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) induced dorsolateral prefrontal cortex plasticity in alcohol dependence.","Journal of physiology, Paris",2013,937-50,,Array,Array,15661300,,"Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) has been shown to reduce acute substance craving in drug addicts, and improve cognition in neuropsychiatric patients. Here we aimed to explore further tDCS induced behavioral and neurophysiological modulation including assessment of relapse rate over a prolonged time course in alcoholism. We examined the effects of repeated anodal tDCS (2mA, 35 cm(2), 20min) over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) on relapse to the use of alcohol in alcoholics from outpatient services, who received additional routine clinical treatment. Furthermore, event related potentials (ERPs), cognitive and frontal executive processes, craving, depressive and anxiety symptoms were obtained before and after treatment. From thirteen alcoholic subjects, seven were randomized to sham-tDCS and six to real tDCS treatment (once a week for five consecutive weeks). Depressive symptoms and craving were reduced to a larger extent in the tDCS group compared to the sham group (p=0.005 and p=0.015, respectively). On the other hand, active tDCS was able to block the increase in neural activation triggered by alcohol related and neutral cues in prefrontal cortex (PFC) as indexed by ERP as seen in the sham-tDCS group. Finally, there was a trend for increased change in executive function in the tDCS group compared to the sham-tDCS group (p=0.082), and, similarly, a trend for more relapses in the tDCS group compared to sham tDCS (four alcoholic subjects (66.7%) vs. one (14.3%), p=0.053).These results confirm the previous findings of tDCS effects on craving in alcoholism and also extend these findings as we showed also tDCS-related mood improvement. However, potential increase in relapse is possible; thus the clinical value of an increase in craving and improvement in depression and executive function needs to be carefully assessed in further studies; including investigation of optimal parameters of stimulation."
"Corticomotor excitability induced by anodal transcranial direct current stimulation with and without non-exhaustive movement.","Brain research",2013,937-50,1529,Array,Array,21320389,,"We investigated whether anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) applied to the motor cortex during non-exhaustive active or passive movements enhances corticomotor excitability after tDCS or whether it reduces post-exercise depression (PED) after non-exhaustive active or passive movements if PED was observed without tDCS. Nine healthy subjects participated in this study. Anodal tDCS with a current of 2 mA was applied to the left scalp over the primary motor area. All subjects underwent the following five interventions: tDCS delivered for 10 min during relaxation (tDCS condition) and repetitive voluntary and passive finger abduction-adduction movements, each performed without and with tDCS for 10 min (active condition, tDCS+active condition, passive condition, tDCS+passive condition). The active movements were performed at 10% maximum voluntary contraction. Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were recorded from the right first dorsal interosseus muscle before the intervention (pre-intervention) and 2 and 10 min after the intervention (post-2 min and post-10 min, respectively). Under the tDCS condition, the MEP amplitudes at post-2 and -10 min were significantly increased compared with those before the intervention. Under the active, passive, and tDCS+active conditions, the MEP amplitudes at post-2 min were significantly decreased compared with those before the interventions. Under the tDCS+passive condition, the MEP amplitude remained unchanged. These results demonstrated that anodal tDCS did not reduce PED after active movements but after passive movements and that the anodal tDCS effects were highly dependent on the state of the subject during stimulation."
"Frequency-dependent enhancement of fluid intelligence induced by transcranial oscillatory potentials.","Current biology : CB",2013,937-50,23,Array,Array,17251360,15,"Everyday problem solving requires the ability to go beyond experience by efficiently encoding and manipulating new information, i.e., fluid intelligence (Gf) [1]. Performance in tasks involving Gf, such as logical and abstract reasoning, has been shown to rely on distributed neural networks, with a crucial role played by prefrontal regions [2]. Synchronization of neuronal activity in the gamma band is a ubiquitous phenomenon within the brain; however, no evidence of its causal involvement in cognition exists to date [3]. Here, we show an enhancement of Gf ability in a cognitive task induced by exogenous rhythmic stimulation within the gamma band. Imperceptible alternating current [4] delivered through the scalp over the left middle frontal gyrus resulted in a frequency-specific shortening of the time required to find the correct solution in a visuospatial abstract reasoning task classically employed to measure Gf abilities (i.e., Raven's matrices) [5]. Crucially, gamma-band stimulation (γ-tACS) selectively enhanced performance only on more complex trials involving conditional/logical reasoning. The present finding supports a direct involvement of gamma oscillatory activity in the mechanisms underlying higher-order human cognition."

Consequently, growing interest emerged to evaluate new strategies to delay or counteract cognitive decline in aging. Here, we assessed immediate effects of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (atDCS) on cognition and previously described detrimental changes in brain activity attributable to aging. Twenty healthy elderly adults were assessed in a crossover sham-controlled design using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and concurrent transcranial DCS administered to the left inferior frontal gyrus. Effects on performance and task-related brain activity were evaluated during overt semantic word generation, a task that is negatively affected by advanced age. Task-absent resting-state fMRI (RS-fMRI) assessed atDCS-induced changes at the network level independent of performance. Twenty matched younger adults served as controls. During sham stimulation, task-related fMRI demonstrated that enhanced bilateral prefrontal activity in older adults was associated with reduced performance. RS-fMRI revealed enhanced anterior and reduced posterior functional brain connectivity. atDCS significantly improved performance in older adults up to the level of younger controls; significantly reduced task-related hyperactivity in bilateral prefrontal cortices, the anterior cingulate gyrus, and the precuneus; and induced a more ""youth-like"" connectivity pattern during RS-fMRI. Our results provide converging evidence from behavioral analysis and two independent functional imaging paradigms that a single session of atDCS can temporarily reverse nonbeneficial effects of aging on cognition and brain activity and connectivity. These findings may translate into novel treatments to ameliorate cognitive decline in normal aging in the future."
"Non-invasive brain stimulation (rTMS and tDCS) in patients with aphasia: Mode of action at the cellular level.","Brain research bulletin",2013,937-50,98,Array,Array,18441418,,"A high proportion of patients who have suffered a stroke also suffer from aphasia. Approximately half of those affected will remain in this state despite intensive language therapy. Non-invasive brain stimulation allows us to directly and focally stimulate areas of the brain. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), methods used in the treatment of aphasia, are based on an imbalance of mutual interhemispheric inhibition. In open and sham-controlled studies, a low-frequency, 1Hz stimulation of the non-lesioned hemisphere (the homologue of Broca's area) for a week or more significantly improved spontaneous speech and anomia in patients with non-fluent aphasia. These positive outcomes from rTMS stimulation developed slowly, often over months following treatment, and persisted. Effects of intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) developed faster than the low-frequency stimulation, and high-activity enhancement was detected in the left hemisphere after the stimulation of Broca's region. Both types of tDCS stimulation resulted in improved comprehension and reduced anomia, their primary modes of action are distinct, however, both share a common site of action with regard to the balance that occurs between inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmitters (synaptic and non-synaptic). Both types of non-invasive stimulation prepare the lesioned brain for better outcome."
"Beyond the silence: bilateral somatosensory stimulation enhances skilled movement quality and neural density in intact behaving rats.","Behavioural brain research",2013,937-50,253,Array,Array,19964238,,"It is thought that a close dialogue between the primary motor (M1) and somatosensory (S1) cortices is necessary for skilled motor learning. The extent of the relative S1 contribution in producing skilled reaching movements, however, is still unclear. Here we used anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), which is able to alter polarity-specific excitability in the S1, to facilitate skilled movement in intact behaving rats. We hypothesized that the critical role of S1 in reaching performance can be enhanced by bilateral tDCS. Pretrained rats were assigned to control or stimulation conditions: (1) UnAno: the unilateral application of an anodal current to the side contralateral to the paw preferred for reaching; (2) BiAno1: bilateral anodal current; (3) BiAno2: a bilateral anodal current with additional 30ms of 65μA pulses every 5s. Rats received tDCS (65μA; 10min/rat) to the S1 during skilled reach training for 20 days (online-effect phase). After-effect assessment occurred for the next ten days in the absence of electrical stimulation. Quantitative and qualitative analyses of online-effects of tDCS showed that UnAno and BiAno1 somatosensory stimulation significantly improve skilled reaching performance. Bilateral BiAno1 stimulation was associated with greater qualitative functional improvement than unilateral UnAno stimulation. tDCS-induced improvements were not observed in the after-effects phase. Quantitative cytoarchitectonic analysis revealed that somatosensory tDCS bilaterally increases cortical neural density. The findings emphasize the central role of bilateral somatosensory feedback in skill acquisition through modulation of cortico-motor excitability."
"Challenges of proper placebo control for non-invasive brain stimulation in clinical and experimental applications.","The European journal of neuroscience",2013,,,Array,Array,23869660,,"A range of techniques are now available for modulating the activity of the brain in healthy people and people with neurological conditions. These techniques, including transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial current stimulation (tCS, which includes direct and alternating current), create magnetic or electrical fields that cross the intact skull and affect neural processing in brain areas near to the scalp location where the stimulation is delivered. TMS and tCS have proved to be valuable tools in behavioural neuroscience laboratories, where causal involvement of specific brain areas in specific tasks can be shown. In clinical neuroscience, the techniques offer the promise of correcting abnormal activity, such as when a stroke leaves a brain area underactive. As the use of brain stimulation becomes more commonplace in laboratories and clinics, we discuss the safety and ethical issues inherent in using the techniques with human participants, and we suggest how to balance scientific integrity with the safety of the participant."

It has been argued that the functional reorganization of language networks after left-hemisphere stroke may engage perilesional left brain areas as well as homologous right-hemisphere regions. In this chapter, we summarize how noninvasive brain stimulation can be used to elucidate mechanisms of plasticity in language networks and enhance language recovery after stroke. We first outline some basic principles of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). We then present evidence from studies in healthy volunteers for a causal role of the right hemisphere in different language functions. Finally, we review recent studies that used TMS or tDCS to promote language recovery after stroke. Most of these studies applied noninvasive brain stimulation over contralateral right-hemisphere areas to suppress maladaptive plasticity. However, some studies also suggest that right-hemisphere regions may beneficially contribute to recovery in some patients. More recently, some investigators have targeted perilesional brain regions to promote neurorehabilitation. In sum, these studies indicate that language recovery after stroke may integrate left- as well as right-hemisphere brain regions to a different degree over the time course of recovery. Although the results of these preliminary studies provide some evidence that noninvasive brain stimulation may promote aphasia recovery, the reported effect sizes are not striking. Future studies on larger patient collectives are needed to explore whether noninvasive brain stimulation can enhance language functions at a level that is clinically relevant."
"Site-Dependent Effects of tDCS Uncover Dissociations in the Communication Network Underlying the Processing of Visual Search.","Brain stimulation",2013,,,Array,Array,19109497,,"Amblyopia is a neurodevelopmental disorder of vision caused by abnormal visual experience during early childhood that is often considered to be untreatable in adulthood. Recently, it has been shown that a novel dichoptic videogame-based treatment for amblyopia can improve visual function in adult patients, at least in part, by reducing inhibition of inputs from the amblyopic eye to the visual cortex. Non-invasive anodal transcranial direct current stimulation has been shown to reduce the activity of inhibitory cortical interneurons when applied to the primary motor or visual cortex. In this double-blind, sham-controlled cross-over study we tested the hypothesis that anodal transcranial direct current stimulation of the visual cortex would enhance the therapeutic effects of dichoptic videogame-based treatment. A homogeneous group of 16 young adults (mean age 22.1 ± 1.1 years) with amblyopia were studied to compare the effect of dichoptic treatment alone and dichoptic treatment combined with visual cortex direct current stimulation on measures of binocular (stereopsis) and monocular (visual acuity) visual function. The combined treatment led to greater improvements in stereoacuity than dichoptic treatment alone, indicating that direct current stimulation of the visual cortex boosts the efficacy of dichoptic videogame-based treatment. This intervention warrants further evaluation as a novel therapeutic approach for adults with amblyopia."
"Task-specific effect of transcranial direct current stimulation on motor learning.","Frontiers in human neuroscience",2013,,7,Array,Array,21340034,,"This study investigated whether manipulation of motor cortex excitability by transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) modulates neuromuscular fatigue and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)-derived prefrontal cortex (PFC) activation. Fifteen healthy men (27.7 ± 8.4 years) underwent anodal (2 mA, 10 min) and sham (2 mA, first 30 s only) tDCS delivered to the scalp over the right motor cortex. Subjects initially performed a baseline sustained submaximal (30 % maximal voluntary isometric contraction, MVC) isometric contraction task (SSIT) of the left elbow flexors until task failure, which was followed 50 min later by either an anodal or sham treatment condition, then a subsequent posttreatment SSIT. Endurance time (ET), torque integral (TI), and fNIRS-derived contralateral PFC oxygenated (O2Hb) and deoxygenated (HHb) hemoglobin concentration changes were determined at task failure. Results indicated that during the baseline and posttreatment SSIT, there were no significant differences in TI and ET, and increases in fNIRS-derived PFC activation at task failure were observed similarly regardless of the tDCS conditions. This suggests that the PFC neuronal activation to maintain muscle force production was not modulated by anodal tDCS."
"Biological Markers in Noninvasive Brain Stimulation Trials in Major Depressive Disorder: A Systematic Review.","The journal of ECT",2013,,,Array,Array,19757102,,"Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a technique that delivers weak electric currents through the scalp. This constant electric current induces shifts in neuronal membrane excitability, resulting in secondary changes in cortical activity. Although tDCS has most of its neuromodulatory effects on the underlying cortex, tDCS effects can also be observed in distant neural networks. Therefore, concomitant EEG monitoring of the effects of tDCS can provide valuable information on the mechanisms of tDCS. In addition, EEG findings can be an important surrogate marker for the effects of tDCS and thus can be used to optimize its parameters. This combined EEG-tDCS system can also be used for preventive treatment of neurological conditions characterized by abnormal peaks of cortical excitability, such as seizures. Such a system would be the basis of a non-invasive closed-loop device. In this article, we present a novel device that is capable of utilizing tDCS and EEG simultaneously. For that, we describe in a step-by-step fashion the main procedures of the application of this device using schematic figures, tables and video demonstrations. Additionally, we provide a literature review on clinical uses of tDCS and its cortical effects measured by EEG techniques."

When targeted to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), anodal, facilitatory tDCS has been shown to improve symptoms in a range of domains including working memory, mood, and pain perception (Boggio et al., 2008a; Dockery et al., 2009; Kalu et al., 2012). However, the mechanisms underlying these promising behavioral effects are not well understood. Here, we investigated brain perfusion changes, as assessed using whole-brain arterial spin labeling (ASL), during tDCS applied to the left DLPFC in healthy humans. We demonstrated increased perfusion in regions closely anatomically connected to the DLPFC during anodal tDCS in conjunction with a decreased functional coupling between the left DLPFC and the thalami bilaterally. Despite highly similar effects on cortical excitability during and after stimulation (Nitsche and Paulus, 2000, 2001), cortical perfusion changes were markedly different during these two time periods, with widespread decreases in cortical perfusion being demonstrated after both anodal and cathodal tDCS compared to the period during stimulation. These findings may at least partially explain the different effects on behavior in these time periods described previously in the motor system (Stagg et al., 2011). In addition, the data presented here provide mechanistic explanations for the behavioral effects of anodal tDCS applied to the left DLPFC in terms of modulating functional connectivity between the DLPFC and thalami, as has been hypothesized previously (Lorenz et al., 2003)."
"[Transcranial direct current stimulation; potential new treatment for unilateral neglect].","Nederlands tijdschrift voor geneeskunde",2013,11425-31,157,Array,Array,23838401,27,"One of the most devastating cognitive deficits following a stroke is when the patient neglects one half of the body and surroundings (unilateral neglect). Unilateral neglect following a stroke has a high prevalence and is one of the most important predictors of poor functional outcome. Various treatment methods have been studied over the past decades but their effects appear too short-term or task-specific and therefore, difficult to extrapolate to other untrained situations. A possible new intervention is transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), which is capable of modulating brain activity by polarizing neurons with the aid of a constant low current. Recent research suggests that inhibiting the intact hemisphere or increasing the neuronal activity in the damaged hemisphere might reduce unilateral neglect. For treating unilateral neglect, tDCS appears to be a promising technique; however, more research is necessary to reveal its therapeutic potential."

"Long-Term Effects of Serial Anodal tDCS on Motion Perception in Subjects with Occipital Stroke Measured in the Unaffected Visual Hemifield.","Frontiers in human neuroscience",2013,314,7,Array,Array,23805097,,"Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a novel neuromodulatory tool that has seen early transition to clinical trials, although the high variability of these findings necessitates further studies in clinically relevant populations. The majority of evidence into effects of repeated tDCS is based on research in the human motor system, but it is unclear whether the long-term effects of serial tDCS are motor-specific or transferable to other brain areas. This study aimed to examine whether serial anodal tDCS over the visual cortex can exogenously induce long-term neuroplastic changes in the visual cortex. However, when the visual cortex is affected by a cortical lesion, up-regulated endogenous neuroplastic adaptation processes may alter the susceptibility to tDCS. To this end, motion perception was investigated in the unaffected hemifield of subjects with unilateral visual cortex lesions. Twelve subjects with occipital ischemic lesions participated in a within-subject, sham-controlled, double-blind study. MRI-registered sham or anodal tDCS (1.5 mA, 20 min) was applied on five consecutive days over the visual cortex. Motion perception was tested before and after stimulation sessions and at 14- and 28-day follow-up. After a 16-day interval an identical study block with the other stimulation condition (anodal or sham tDCS) followed. Serial anodal tDCS over the visual cortex resulted in an improvement in motion perception, a function attributed to MT/V5. This effect was still measurable at 14- and 28-day follow-up measurements. Thus, this may represent evidence for long-term tDCS-induced plasticity and has implications for the design of studies examining the time course of tDCS effects in both the visual and motor systems."
"Magnetoencephalographic evidence for the modulation of cortical swallowing processing by transcranial direct current stimulation.",NeuroImage,2013,314,83,Array,Array,10990547,,"Swallowing is a complex neuromuscular task that is processed within multiple regions of the human brain. Rehabilitative treatment options for dysphagia due to neurological diseases are limited. Because the potential for adaptive cortical changes in compensation of disturbed swallowing is recognized, neuromodulation techniques like transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) are currently considered as a treatment option. Here we evaluate the effect of tDCS on cortical swallowing network activity and behavior. In a double-blind crossover study, anodal tDCS (20min, 1mA) or sham stimulation was administered over the left or right swallowing motor cortex in 21 healthy subjects in separate sessions. Cortical activation was measured using magnetoencephalography (MEG) before and after tDCS during cued ""simple"", ""fast"" and ""challenged"" swallow tasks with increasing levels of difficulty. Swallowing response times and accuracy were measured. Significant bilateral enhancement of cortical swallowing network activation was found in the theta frequency range after left tDCS in the fast swallow task (p=0.006) and following right tDCS in the challenged swallow task (p=0.007), but not after sham stimulation. No relevant behavioral effects were observed on swallow response time, but swallow precision improved after left tDCS (p<0.05). Anodal tDCS applied over the swallowing motor cortex of either hemisphere was able to increase bilateral swallow-related cortical network activation in a frequency specific manner. These neuroplastic effects were associated with subtle behavioral gains during complex swallow tasks in healthy individuals suggesting that tDCS deserves further evaluation as a treatment tool for dysphagia."

Anodal tDCS of the cerebellum increases the excitability of the cerebellar cortex. We tested the effects of anodal tDCS applied over the cerebellum in ataxic patients. We studied (a) stretch reflexes (SR) in upper limb (SLSR: short-latency stretch reflexes; LLSR: long-latency stretch reflexes), (b) a coordination functional task in upper limbs based on mechanical counters (MCT: mechanical counter test), and (c) computerized posturography. tDCS did not change the amplitude of SLSR, but reduced significantly the amplitudes of LLSR. tDCS did not improve the MCT scores and did not modify posture. We suggest that anodal tDCS of the cerebellum reduces the amplitudes of LLSR by increasing the inhibitory effect exerted by the cerebellar cortex upon cerebellar nuclei. The absence of effect upon upper limb coordination and posture suggests that the cerebello-cerebral networks subserving these functions are less responsive to anodal tDCS of the cerebellum. Anodal tDCS of the cerebellum represents a novel experimental tool to investigate the effects of the cerebellar cortex on the modulation of the amplitudes of LLSR."
"Subcortical effects of transcranial direct current stimulation in the rat.","The Journal of physiology",2013,2437-47,591,Array,Array,23774279,"Pt 16","Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) affects neurons at both cortical and subcortical levels. The subcortical effects involve several descending motor systems but appeared to be relatively weak, as only small increases in the amplitude of subcortically initiated descending volleys and a minute shortening of latencies of these volleys were found. The aim of the present study was therefore to evaluate the consequences of facilitation of these volleys on the ensuing muscle activation. The experiments were carried out on deeply anaesthetized rats without neuromuscular blockade. Effects of tDCS were tested on EMG potentials recorded from neck muscles evoked by weak (20-60 μA) single, double or triple stimuli applied in the medial longitudinal fascicle (MLF) or in the red nucleus (RN). Short latencies of these potentials were compatible with monosynaptic or disynaptic actions of reticulospinal and disynaptic or trisynaptic actions of rubrospinal neurons on neck motoneurons. Despite only weak effects on indirect descending volleys, the EMG responses from both the MLF and the RN were potently facilitated by cathodal tDCS and depressed by anodal tDCS. Both the facilitation and the depression developed relatively rapidly (within the first minute) but both outlasted tDCS and were present for up to 1 h after tDCS. The study thus demonstrates long-lasting effects of tDCS on subcortical neurons in the rat, albeit evoked by an opposite polarity of tDCS to that found to be effective on subcortical neurons in the cat investigated in the preceding study, or for cortical neurons in the humans."

This revealed that tDCS did not affect learning but did degrade frequency discrimination during both days. Follow-up testing 2-3 months after stimulation showed no long-term effects. Following the unexpected results, two additional experiments examined the effects of tDCS on the underlying mechanisms of frequency discrimination, place and temporal coding. Place coding underlies frequency selectivity and was measured using psychophysical tuning curves with broader curves indicating poorer frequency selectivity. Temporal coding is determined by measuring the ability to discriminate sounds with different fine temporal structure. We found that tDCS does not broaden frequency selectivity but instead degraded the ability to discriminate tones with different fine temporal structure. The overall results suggest anodal tDCS applied over auditory cortex degrades frequency discrimination by affecting temporal, but not place, coding mechanisms."

We applied tDCS (anodal, cathodal, and sham) in 21 male participants (mean age 23.8 ± 3.06), over the left M1 with a current of 2 mA for 20 min. Following this, we recorded the EEG at C3, C4, and Cz and surrounding C3 and C4 electrodes. Analyses of C3 and C4 showed significant effects for biological vs. non-biological movement (p = 0.005), and differential hemisphere effects according to the type of stimulation (p = 0.04) and type of movement (p = 0.02). Analyses of surrounding electrodes revealed significant interaction effects considering type of stimulation and imagery or observation of biological or non-biological movement (p = 0.03). The main findings of this study were (1) Mu desynchronization during biological movement of the hand region in the contralateral hemisphere after sham tDCS; (2) polarity-dependent modulation effects of tDCS on the Mu rhythm, i.e., anodal tDCS led to Mu synchronization while cathodal tDCS led to Mu desynchronization during movement observation and imagery (3) specific focal and opposite inter-hemispheric effects, i.e., contrary effects for the surrounding electrodes during imagery condition and also for inter-hemispheric electrodes (C3 vs. C4). These findings provide insights into the cortical oscillations during movement observation and imagery. Furthermore, it shows that tDCS can be highly focal when guided by a behavioral task."

"Noninvasive remote activation of the ventral midbrain by transcranial direct current stimulation of prefrontal cortex.","Translational psychiatry",2013,,3,Array,Array,23756377,,"The midbrain lies deep within the brain and has an important role in reward, motivation, movement and the pathophysiology of various neuropsychiatric disorders such as Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, depression and addiction. To date, the primary means of acting on this region has been with pharmacological interventions or implanted electrodes. Here we introduce a new noninvasive brain stimulation technique that exploits the highly interconnected nature of the midbrain and prefrontal cortex to stimulate deep brain regions. Using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the prefrontal cortex, we were able to remotely activate the interconnected midbrain and cause increases in participants' appraisals of facial attractiveness. Participants with more enhanced prefrontal/midbrain connectivity following stimulation exhibited greater increases in attractiveness ratings. These results illustrate that noninvasive direct stimulation of prefrontal cortex can induce neural activity in the distally connected midbrain, which directly effects behavior.

Twelve healthy subjects underwent anodal, cathodal and sham tDCS on separate days. Stimulation was applied over the right IFG for 20min at 2mA. Subjects participated in the pricing task where they evaluated the presented items under WTA and WTP framings during tDCS intervention. The results showed that the WTA/WTP ratio after anodal tDCS was significantly higher than that after cathodal one. In addition, we found that the reaction time during the cathodal tDCS condition was significantly longer compared to those during anodal or sham tDCS conditions. Our findings suggest the functional relevance of the right IFG for producing endowment effect."
"Testing the limits: Investigating the effect of tDCS dose on working memory enhancement in healthy controls.",Neuropsychologia,2013,,51,Array,Array,11513242,9,"Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive form of brain stimulation which has been shown to induce changes in brain activity and subsequent functioning. In particular, there is a rapidly growing evidence base showing that anodal tDCS applied to the left prefrontal cortex (PFC) is able to enhance aspects of cognitive functioning, in particular working memory (WM). This has led to both excitement and concerns regarding the possibility of 'electrodoping' in order to greatly improve one's cognitive performance. We investigated the behavioural and neurophysiological effects of increasing the current (or 'dose') of tDCS on the degree of WM improvement in healthy controls. Single sessions of 1 mA, 2 mA and sham anodal tDCS to the left PFC were undertaken over a period of three weeks. Participants underwent a WM task at three time points post-stimulation (0, 20 and 40 min) with concurrent electrophysiological (EEG) recordings. Our results showed that while active tDCS can enhance behavioural performance, with neurophysiological findings indicating improve efficiency of cognitive processing; we showed that 1 mA produced the most significant effects. These findings are somewhat unexpected as tDCS dose effects in cognitive enhancement have been shown previously in patient populations. Our results provide valuable information regarding the potential limits of tDCS induced cognitive enhancement in healthy controls, as well as providing additional insights into the possible mechanisms of action of tDCS."
"Therapeutic effects of non-invasive brain stimulation with direct currents (tDCS) in neuropsychiatric diseases.",NeuroImage,2013,,,Array,Array,11528428,,"Neuroplasticity, which is the dynamic structural and functional reorganization of central nervous system connectivity due to environmental and internal demands, is recognized as a major physiological basis for adaption of cognition, and behavior, and thus of utmost importance for normal brain function. Pathological alterations of plasticity are increasingly explored as pathophysiological foundation of diverse neurological and psychiatric diseases. Non-invasive brain stimulation techniques (NIBS), such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), are able to induce and modulate neuroplasticity in humans. Therefore, they have potential to alter pathological plasticity on the one hand, and foster physiological plasticity on the other, in neuropsychiatric diseases to reduce symptoms, and enhance rehabilitation. tDCS is an emerging NIBS tool, which induces glutamatergic plasticity via application of relatively weak currents through the scalp in humans. In the last years its efficacy to treat neuropsychiatric diseases has been explored increasingly. In this review, we will give an overview of pathological alterations of plasticity in neuropsychiatric diseases, gather clinical studies involving tDCS to ameliorate symptoms, and discuss future directions of application, with an emphasis on optimizing stimulation effects."
"Ethics of the Electrified Mind: Defining Issues and Perspectives on the Principled Use of Brain Stimulation in Medical Research and Clinical Care.","Brain topography",2013,,,Array,Array,11709163,,"In recent years, non-pharmacologic approaches to modifying human neural activity have gained increasing attention. One of these approaches is brain stimulation, which involves either the direct application of electrical current to structures in the nervous system or the indirect application of current by means of electromagnetic induction. Interventions that manipulate the brain have generally been regarded as having both the potential to alleviate devastating brain-related conditions and the capacity to create unforeseen and unwanted consequences. Hence, although brain stimulation techniques offer considerable benefits to society, they also raise a number of ethical concerns. In this paper we will address various dilemmas related to brain stimulation in the context of clinical practice and biomedical research. We will survey current work involving deep brain stimulation, transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial direct current stimulation. We will reflect upon relevant similarities and differences between them, and consider some potentially problematic issues that may arise within the framework of established principles of medical ethics: nonmaleficence and beneficence, autonomy, and justice."

A growing body of investigations has shown the efficacy of both modalities in facilitating recovery from chronic aphasia, while data regarding subacute aphasia are much more limited and evidence in the acute post-stroke phase are still lacking. Much remains unknown about how these techniques cause clinical improvement or about their long-term efficacy, side-effects, and safety. In this article, we examine the data demonstrating the safety and efficacy of TMS and tDCS, discuss the major differences between them, and consider how those differences may inform the use of each modality. We also consider the different models of neuroplasticity in the setting of post-stroke aphasia and how these models may influence when and in which patients each modality would impart the most benefit."

There is growing evidence that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), when given during cognitive tasks, improves performance. This randomized, controlled trial explored the potential synergistic effects of CT combined with tDCS in healthy participants. Altogether, 60 healthy participants were randomized to receive either active or sham tDCS administered during training on an adaptive CT task (dual n-back task), or tDCS alone, over 10 daily sessions. Cognitive testing (working memory, processing speed, executive function, reaction time) was conducted at baseline, end of the 10 sessions, and at 4-wk follow-up to examine potential transfer effects to non-trained tasks. Altogether, 54 participants completed the study. Over the 10 'online' sessions, participants in the active tDCS+CT condition performed more accurately on the CT task than participants who received sham tDCS+CT. The performance enhancing effect, however, was present only during tDCS and did not result in greater learning (i.e. improvement over sessions) on the CT task. These results confirm prior reports of enhancement of cognitive function during tDCS stimulation. At follow-up, the active tDCS+CT group, but not the sham tDCS+CT group, showed greater gains on a non-trained test of attention and working memory than the tDCS-only group (p < 0.01). Although this gain can mainly be attributable to training, this result suggests that active tDCS may have a role in further enhancing outcomes."
"Motor and parietal cortex stimulation for phantom limb pain and sensations.",Pain,2013,181-4,154,Array,Array,23707312,8,"Brain stimulation therapies have demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of depression and treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Non-invasive brain stimulation in the treatment of depression has grown substantially due to their favorable adverse effect profiles. The role of transcranial direct current stimulation in TRD is unclear, but emerging data suggests that it may be an effective add-on treatment. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation has demonstrated efficacy in TRD that is supported by several multicenter randomized controlled trials. Though, vagus nerve stimulation has been found to be effective in some studies, sham controlled studies were equivocal. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a well-established brain stimulation treatment for severe depression and TRD, yet stigma and cognitive adverse effects limit its wider use. Magnetic seizure therapy has a more favorable cognitive adverse effect profile; however, equivalent efficacy to ECT needs to be established. Deep brain stimulation may play a role in severe TRD and controlled trials are now underway."
"Effects of non-pharmacological pain treatments on brain states.","Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology",2013,181-4,124,Array,Array,23706958,10,"BACKGROUND: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), an emerging technique of noninvasive brain stimulation, has shown to produce beneficial neural effects in consequence with improvements in motor behavior. There are not many studies examining the use of tDCS for lower limb motor control and learning. Most studies using tDCS for facilitating lower limb motor coordination have applied tDCS to the lower limb motor cortex (M1). As the cerebellum is also critically involved in movement control, it is important to dissociate the effect of tDCS on the cerebellum and M1 with respect to lower limb motor control before we begin the application of tDCS as a neuromodulatory tool. OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS: The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of cerebellar vs. motor cortical tDCS on short term ankle visuomotor learning in healthy individuals. METHODS: Eight healthy individuals practiced a skilled ankle motor tracking task while receiving either facilitatory anodal tDCS to cerebellum, inhibitory cathodal tDCS to cerebellum, facilitatory anodal tDCS to M1, inhibitory cathodal tDCS to M1 or sham stimulation. Pre- and post-measures of changes in cortical excitability of the tibialis anterior muscle and measures of tracking accuracy were assessed. RESULTS: Anodal cerebellar, cathodal cerebellar, and anodal M1 stimulation improved target-tracking accuracy of the ankle. This was not dependent on the observed changes in motor cortical excitability of the tibialis anterior muscle. CONCLUSION(S): Polarity independent effects of tDCS on cerebellum were observed. The present study shows that modulation effects of tDCS can occur because of changes in the cerebellum, a structure implicated in several forms of motor learning, providing an additional way in which tDCS can be used to improve motor coordination."

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled, parallel design enrolling 24 age-, gender-matched, drug-free, depressed subjects. Anode and cathode were placed over the left and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. We performed a word Emotional Stroop Task collecting the response times (RTs) for positive-, negative-, and neutral-related words. The emotional Stroop effect for negative vs. neutral and vs. positive words was used as the measure of attentional bias. RESULTS: At baseline, RTs were significantly slower for negative vs. positive words. We found that active but not sham tDCS significantly modified the negative attentional bias, abolishing slower RT for negative words. CONCLUSION: Active but not sham tDCS significantly modified the negative attentional bias. These findings add evidence that a single tDCS session transiently induces potent changes in affective processing, which might be one of the mechanisms of tDCS underlying mood changes."
"tDCS over the left prefrontal cortex enhances cognitive control for positive affective stimuli.","PloS one",2013,e62219,8,Array,Array,23704874,5,"Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) is a neuromodulation technique with promising results for enhancing cognitive information processes. So far, however, research has mainly focused on the effects of tDCS on cognitive control operations for non-emotional material. Therefore, our aim was to investigate the effects on cognitive control considering negative versus positive material. For this sham-controlled, within-subjects study, we selected a homogeneous sample of twenty-five healthy participants. By using behavioral measures and event related potentials (ERP) as indexes, we aimed to investigate whether a single session of anodal tDCS of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) would have specific effects in enhancing cognitive control for positive and negative valenced stimuli. After tDCS over the left DLPFC (and not sham control stimulation), we observed more negative N450 amplitudes along with faster reaction times when inhibiting a habitual response to happy compared to sad facial expressions. Gender did not influence the effects of tDCS on cognitive control for emotional information. In line with the Valence Theory of side-lateralized activity, this stimulation protocol might have led to a left dominant (relative to right) prefrontal cortical activity, resulting in augmented cognitive control specifically for positive relative to negative stimuli. To verify that tDCS induces effects that are in line with all aspects of the well known Valence Theory, future research should investigate the effects of tDCS over the left vs. right DLPFC on cognitive control for emotional information."
"Differential effects of dual and unihemispheric motor cortex stimulation in older adults.","The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience",2013,e62219,33,Array,Array,3397865,21,"Bihemispheric transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is thought to upregulate excitability of the primary motor cortex (M1) using anodal stimulation while concurrently downregulating contralateral M1 using cathodal stimulation. This ""dual"" tDCS method enhances motor learning in healthy subjects and facilitates motor recovery after stroke. However, its impact on motor system activity and connectivity remains unknown. Therefore, we assessed neural correlates of dual and unihemispheric anodal tDCS effects in 20 healthy older subjects in a randomized, sham-controlled study using a cross-over design. Participants underwent tDCS and simultaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging during a choice reaction time task and at rest. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) allowed us to relate potential functional changes to structural parameters. The resting-state analysis demonstrated that, compared with sham, both dual and anodal tDCS decreased connectivity of right hippocampus and M1 (contralateral to the anode position) while increasing connectivity in the left prefrontal cortex. Notably, dual but not anodal tDCS enhanced connectivity of the left dorsal posterior cingulate cortex. Furthermore, dual tDCS yielded stronger activations in bilateral M1 compared with anodal tDCS when participants used either their left or right hand during the motor task. The corresponding tDCS-induced changes in laterality of activations were related to the microstructural status of transcallosal motor fibers. In conclusion, our results suggest that the impact of bihemispheric tDCS cannot be explained by mere add-on effects of anodal and concurrent cathodal stimulation, but rather by complex network modulations involving interhemispheric interactions and areas associated with motor control in the dorsal posterior cingulate cortex."

Both methods are relatively safe if appropriate guidelines are followed, and both can exert neuromodulatory effects that may be applied to the investigation of the autonomic nervous system (ANS). In addition, ANS measures can shed important light onto the neurobiologic mechanisms of NIBS. Here we present a systematic review on studies testing NIBS and ANS simultaneously. We structure our findings into four broad (not mutually exclusive) categories: (i) studies in which ANS function was modified by NIBS versus those in which it was not; (ii) studies in which NIBS was used to understand ANS function, (iii) studies in which ANS was used to understand NIBS mechanisms and (iv) NIBS/ANS studies conducted in healthy subjects versus those in patients with neuropsychiatric diseases. Forty-four articles were identified and no conclusive evidence of the effects of NIBS on ANS was observed, mainly because of the heterogeneity of included studies. Based on a comprehensive summary of this literature we propose how NIBS might be further developed to enhance our understanding of the cortical mechanisms of autonomic regulation and perhaps to modulate autonomic activity for therapeutic purposes."

Beyond its clinical antidepressant effects, it improves motor performance, learning and memory formation. These effects might at least be partially caused by the impact of serotonin on neuroplasticity, which is thought to be an important foundation of the respective functions. In principal accordance, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors enhance long-term potentiation-like plasticity induced by transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in humans. As other neuromodulators have discernable effects on different kinds of plasticity in humans, here we were interested to explore the impact of serotonin on paired associative stimulation (PAS)-induced plasticity, which induces a more focal kind of plasticity, as compared with tDCS, shares some features with spike timing-dependent plasticity, and is thought to be relative closely related to learning processes. In this single-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized crossover study, we administered a single dose of 20 mg citalopram or placebo medication and applied facilitatory- and excitability-diminishing PAS to the left motor cortex of 14 healthy subjects. Cortico-spinal excitability was explored via single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation-elicited MEP amplitudes up to the next evening after plasticity induction. After citalopram administration, inhibitory PAS-induced after-effects were abolished and excitatory PAS-induced after-effects were enhanced trendwise, as compared with the respective placebo conditions. These results show that serotonin modulates PAS-induced neuroplasticity by shifting it into the direction of facilitation, which might help to explain mechanism of positive therapeutic effects of serotonin in learning and medical conditions characterized by enhanced inhibitory or reduced facilitatory plasticity, including depression and stroke."
"[Electroconvulsive therapy in schizophrenia].","Nihon rinsho. Japanese journal of clinical medicine",2013,e62219,71,Array,Array,15999258,4,"Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) was initially developed as a treatment for schizophrenia. Currently, the application of ECT for schizophrenia is controversial because of several international guidelines; however, catatonia is acceptable for the indications by all guidelines. Schizophrenic patients with affective, catatonic, and positive symptoms of recent onset may respond favorably to ECT. Additionally, ECT may improve responsivity to pharmacotherapy for some indications. Therefore, a combination of ECT with pharmacotherapy including clozapine may be effective for the pharmacotherapy -resistant schizophrenia. Another argument is that the relapse rate after ECT response is very high compared to that of mood disorders; development of maintenance therapy(pharmacotherapy or ECT) is anticipated for the prevention of relapse. Because maintenance ECT seems to be a burden on remitted patients, to study both maintenance pharmacotherapy and the novel application of non-invasive treatment, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), for maintenance therapy instead of ECT could be fruitful."

However, the cortical control of the chest wall muscles during different breathing tasks is not known. We studied chest wall intermuscular coherence during various task-related lung volume excursions in 10 healthy adults (34 ± 15 yr; 2 men, 8 women) and determined if transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) could modulate chest wall intermuscular coherence during these tasks. Simultaneous assessment of regional intercostal and oblique electromyographic activity was measured while participants performed standardized tidal breathing, speech, maximum phonation, and vital capacity tasks. Lung volume and chest wall kinematics were determined using variable inductance plethysmography. We found that chest wall area of intermuscular coherence was greater during tidal and speech breathing compared with phonation and vital capacity (all P < 0.05) and between tidal breathing compared with speech breathing (P < 0.05). Anodal tDCS increased chest wall area of intermuscular coherence from 0.04 ± 0.09 prestimulation to 0.18 ± 0.19 poststimulation for vital capacity (P < 0.05). Sham tDCS and cathodal tDCS had no effect on coherence during lung volume excursions. Chest wall kinematics were not affected by tDCS. Our findings indicate that lung volume excursions about the midrange of vital capacity elicit a greater area of chest wall intermuscular coherence compared with lung volume excursions spanning the entire range of vital capacity in healthy adults. Our findings also demonstrate that brief tDCS may modulate the cortical control of the chest wall muscles in a stimulation- and lung volume excursion task-dependent manner but does not affect chest wall kinematics in healthy adults."

However the temporal evolution of online- and after-effects of tDCS on functional connectivity (FC) within and across the stimulated motor cortices (M1) still remain elusive. In the present study, two different tDCS setups were investigated: (i) unilateral M1 tDCS (anode over right M1, cathode over the contralateral supraorbital region) and (ii) bilateral M1 tDCS (anode over right M1, cathode over left M1). In a randomized single-blinded cross-over design, 12 healthy subjects underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging at rest before, during and after 20 min of either bi-, unilateral, or sham M1 tDCS. Seed-based FC analysis was used to investigate tDCS-induced changes across and within M1. We found that bilateral M1 tDCS induced (a) a decrease in interhemispheric FC during stimulation and (b) an increase in intracortical FC within right M1 after termination of the intervention. While unilateral M1 tDCS also resulted in similar effects during stimulation, no such changes could be observed after termination of tDCS. Our results provide evidence that depending on the electrode montage, tDCS acts upon a modulation of either intracortical and/or interhemispheric processing of M1."

Experimental data in healthy subjects extend the cerebellar role to learning, emotional and mood control. The need for a non-invasive tool to influence cerebellar function in normal and pathological conditions led researchers to develop transcranial cerebellar direct current stimulation (tcDCS). tcDCS, like tDCS, depends on the principle that weak direct currents delivered at around 2mA for minutes over the cerebellum through surface electrodes induce prolonged changes in cerebellar function. tcDCS modulates several cerebellar skills in humans including motor control, learning and emotional processing. tcDCS also influences the cerebello-brain interactions induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), walking adaptation, working memory and emotional recognition. Hence tcDCS is a simple physiological tool that can improve our physiological understanding of the human cerebellum, and should prove useful also in patients with cerebellar dysfunction or psychiatric disorders and those undergoing neurorehabilitation to enhance neuroplasticity."
"a-tDCS Differential Modulation of Corticospinal Excitability: The Effects of Electrode Size.","Brain stimulation",2013,e62219,,Array,Array,15318880,,"BACKGROUND: Novel noninvasive brain stimulation techniques such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) have been developed in recent years. tDCS-induced corticospinal excitability changes depend on two important factors: current density and electrodes size. Despite clinical success with existing tDCS parameters; optimal protocols are still not entirely set. OBJECTIVE: The current study aimed to investigate the effects of anodal tDCS (a-tDCS) with three electrode sizes on corticospinal excitability. METHODS: a-tDCS was applied with three active electrode sizes of 12, 24 and 35 cm(2) with a constant current density of 0.029 mA/cm(2) on twelve right handed healthy individuals (mean age: 34.5 ± 10.32 years) in different sessions at least 48 h apart. a-tDCS was applied continuously for 10 min, with a constant reference electrode size of 35 cm(2). The corticospinal excitability of extensor carpi radialis muscle (ECR) was measured before and immediately after the intervention and at 10, 20 and 30 min thereafter. RESULTS: We found that smaller electrode may produce more focal current density and could lead to more effective and localized neural modulation than the larger ones. Post hoc comparisons showed that active electrode of 12 cm(2) size induces the biggest increase in the corticospinal excitability compared to bigger electrode sizes, 24 cm(2) (P = 0.002) and 35 cm(2) (P = 0.000). There was no significant difference between two larger electrode sizes (24 cm(2) and 35 cm(2)) (P = 0.177). a-tDCS resulted in significant excitability enhancement lasting for 30 min after the end of stimulation in the 12 and 24 cm(2) electrode size conditions (P < 0.005). However, in 35 cm(2) electrode size condition, the MEP amplitudes of the ECR did not differ significantly from baseline value in 20 and 30 min post stimulation (P > 0.005). CONCLUSION: Reducing stimulation electrode size to one third of the conventional one results in spatially more focused stimulation and increases the efficacy of a-tDCS for induction of larger corticospinal excitability. This may be due to the fact that larger electrodes stimulate nearby cortical functional areas which can have inhibitory effects on primary motor cortex."

We performed a systematic review with meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to collate the available evidence in adults with residual motor impairments as a result of stroke. The primary outcome was change in motor function or impairment as a result of transcranial direct current stimulation, using any reported electrode montage, with or without adjunct physical therapy. The search yielded 15 relevant studies comprising 315 subjects. Compared with sham, cortical stimulation did not produce statistically significant improvements in motor performance when measured immediately after the intervention (anodal stimulation: facilitation of the affected cortex: standardized mean difference = 0·05, P = 0·71; cathodal stimulation: inhibition of the nonaffected cortex: standardized mean difference = 0·39, P = 0·08; bihemispheric stimulation: standardized mean difference = 0·24, P = 0·39). When the data were analyzed according to stroke characteristics, statistically significant improvements were evident for those with chronic stroke (standardized mean difference = 0·45, P = 0·01) and subjects with mild-to-moderate stroke impairments (standardized mean difference = 0·37, P = 0·02). Transcranial direct current stimulation is likely to be effective in enhancing motor performance in the short term when applied selectively to patients with stroke. Given the range of stimulation variables and heterogeneous nature of stroke, this modality is still experimental and further research is required to determine its clinical merit in stroke rehabilitation."

When a definitive lack of responsiveness to conservative treatments is ascertained and medication overuse headache is excluded, neuromodulation options can be considered in selected cases.Here, the various invasive and non-invasive approaches, such as hypothalamic deep brain stimulation, occipital nerve stimulation, stimulation of sphenopalatine ganglion, cervical spinal cord stimulation, vagus nerve stimulation, transcranial direct current stimulation, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation are extensively published although proper RCT-based evidence is limited. The European Headache Federation herewith provides a consensus statement on the clinical use of neuromodulation in headache, based on theoretical background, clinical data, and side effect of each method. This international consensus further gives recommendations for future studies on these new approaches.In spite of a growing field of stimulation devices in headaches treatment, further controlled studies to validate, strengthen and disseminate the use of neurostimulation are clearly warranted. Consequently, until these data are available any neurostimulation device should only be used in patients with medically intractable syndromes from tertiary headache centers either as part of a valid study or have shown to be effective in such controlled studies with an acceptable side effect profile."
"Putative physiological mechanisms underlying tDCS analgesic effects.","Frontiers in human neuroscience",2013,,7,Array,Array,24133434,,"In this study, we explored the representation of an incongruent action (instrumentally incorrect use of an object) in comparison with sentences ending with an incongruent action word, taking into account the role of the activation of the left dorsolateral pFC (DLPFC). This activity was appositely modulated by transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). The effect of tDCS when participants processed congruent/incongruent object-related actions (Experiment 1) or sentences (Experiment 2) was verified by measuring changes in the ERP N400, error rates (ERs), and RTs. In Experiment 1, 30 participants performed the detection task within a dynamic context (video tapes representing a sequence of four action frames). In Experiment 2, 28 participants read sentences that represented object-related actions. The stimulation effect (a cathode applied to the DLPFC and an anode to the right supraorbital region) was analyzed by comparing the ER, RT, and ERP profiles before and after stimulation (or sham treatment). A significant reduction of the N400 was observed for incongruent stimuli in the case of cathodal (inhibitory) stimulation of the DLPFC in comparison with prestimulation conditions for Experiment 1, but not Experiment 2. Moreover, ERs were increased, and RTs were reduced in response to incongruent conditions after tDCS, but not after sham stimulation in Experiment 1. It is suggested that perturbation of the DLPFC may limit the ability to analyze a semantically anomalous action sequence as a reduced N400 ERP effect and increased random responses was observed. Finally, the contribution of the frontal area to the semantic processing of actions is discussed."
"The world can look better: enhancing beauty experience with brain stimulation.","Social cognitive and affective neuroscience",2013,,,Array,Array,24132459,,"Patients with clinical diseases often present psychiatric conditions whose pharmacological treatment is hampered due to hazardous interactions with the clinical treatment and/or disease. This is particularly relevant for major depressive disorder, the most common psychiatric disorder in the general hospital. In this context, nonpharmacological interventions could be useful therapies; and, among those, noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) might be an interesting option. The main methods of NIBS are repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), which was recently approved as a nonresearch treatment for some psychiatric conditions, and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a technique that is currently limited to research scenarios but has shown promising results. Therefore, our aim was to review the main medical conditions associated with high depression rates, the main obstacles for depression treatment, and whether these therapies could be a useful intervention for such conditions. We found that depression is an important and prevalent comorbidity in a variety of diseases such as epilepsy, stroke, Parkinson's disease, myocardial infarction, cancer, and in other conditions such as pregnancy and in patients without enteral access. We found that treatment of depression is often suboptimal within the above contexts and that rTMS and tDCS therapies have been insufficiently appraised. We discuss whether rTMS and tDCS could have a significant impact in treating depression that develops within a clinical context, considering its unique characteristics such as the absence of pharmacological interactions, the use of a nonenteral route, and as an augmentation therapy for antidepressants."

The purpose of this article is to draw attention to the potential importance of ipsilateral descending pathways for functional recovery after stroke, and the use of non-invasive brain stimulation (NBS) protocols of the contralesional primary motor cortex (M1). Conventionally NBS is used to suppress contralesional M1, and to attenuate transcallosal inhibition onto the ipsilesional M1. There has been little consideration of the fact that contralesional M1 suppression may also reduce excitability of ipsilateral descending pathways that may be important for paretic upper limb control for some patients. One such ipsilateral pathway is the cortico-reticulo-propriospinal pathway (CRPP). In this review we outline a neurophysiological model to explain how contralesional M1 may gain control of the paretic arm via the CRPP. We conclude that the relative importance of the CRPP for motor control in individual patients must be considered before using NBS to suppress contralesional M1. Neurophysiological, neuroimaging, and clinical assessments can assist this decision making and facilitate the translation of NBS into the clinical setting."

Despite the increasing number of tDCS studies, it still remains questionable whether tDCS is suitable for modulating performance in arithmetic tasks and whether a single tDCS session may cause brain activity changes that can be detected with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We asked healthy participants to repeatedly solve simple multiplication tasks in three conditions: STIMULATION (anodal tDCS over the right angular gyrus, AG), SHAM (identical electrode set-up without stimulation), and CONTROL (no electrodes attached). Before and after tDCS, we used fMRI to examine changes in brain activity. Behavioural results indicate that a single session of tDCS did not modulate task performance significantly. However, fMRI measurements revealed that the neural correlates of multiplication were modified following a single session of anodal tDCS. In the bilateral AG, activity was significantly higher for multiplication problems rehearsed during active tDCS, as compared to multiplication problems rehearsed without tDCS or during sham tDCS. In sum, we present first neuro-functional evidence that tDCS modulates arithmetic processing. Implications of these findings for future tDCS studies and for the rehabilitation of acalculic patients with deficits in arithmetic fact retrieval are discussed."

However, its influence on verbal fluency still needs to be fully proved. In the present study, we explored the effects of different electrode montages on a semantic fluency task, aimed at comparing their effectiveness in affecting language production. Ninety healthy, right-handed volunteers were randomly assigned to receive one of the following stimulation protocols: (1) anode over the left frontal cortex/cathode over the right supraorbital (rSO) area, (2) anode over the left fronto-temporal (lFT) cortex/cathode over the rSO area, (3) anode over the lFT cortex/cathode over the right FT cortex, (4) anode over the lFT cortex/big-size cathode over the rSO area, (5) sham. In the active stimulation conditions, 2 mA current was delivered for 20 min. Participants performed the semantic fluency task before the stimulation, immediately after it, and 15 min after the first post-stimulation task. Although none of the different protocols improved language production immediately after the stimulation, anodal stimulation over the left frontal cortex (standard-size cathode over the rSO area) improved fluency at the second post-stimulation task. This proved that small differences in either active electrode positioning, or reference positioning/size can impact tDCS behavioral effects also in the cognitive domain. These findings, which can be sometimes missed when tested immediately after the stimulation only, add new information on tDCS spatial and temporal features, thus providing new indications to increase the effectiveness of stimulation protocols."
"Electrode montage dependent effects of transcranial direct current stimulation on semantic fluency.","Behavioural brain research",2013,1279-86,248,Array,Array,23597838,,"Background: Transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive procedure that achieves polarity-dependent modulation of neuronal membrane potentials. It has recently been used as a functional intervention technique for the treatment of psychiatric and neurological diseases; however, its neuronal mechanisms have not been fully investigated in vivo. Objective/Hypothesis: To investigate whether the application of cathodal or anodal tDCS affects extracellular dopamine and serotonin levels in the rat striatum. Methods: Stimulation and in vivo microdialysis were carried out under urethane anesthesia, and microdialysis probes were slowly inserted into the striatum. After the collection of baseline fractions in the rat striatum, cathodal or anodal tDCS was applied continuously for 10 min with a current intensity of 800 μA from an electrode placed on the skin of the scalp. Dialysis samples were collected every 10 min until at least 400 min after the onset of stimulation. Results: Following the application of cathodal, but not anodal, tDCS for 10 min, extracellular dopamine levels increased for more than 400 min in the striatum. There were no significant changes in extracellular serotonin levels. Conclusion: These findings suggest that tDCS has a direct and/or indirect effect on the dopaminergic system in the rat basal ganglia."
"Transcranial direct-current stimulation increases extracellular dopamine levels in the rat striatum.","Frontiers in systems neuroscience",2013,1279-86,7,Array,Array,23596399,,"Whether visual subliminal processing involves semantic processing is still being debated. To examine this, we combined a passive electroencephalogram (EEG) study with an application of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). In the masked-face priming paradigm, we presented a subliminal prime preceding the target stimulus. Participants were asked to determine whether the target face was a famous face, indicated by a button press. The prime and target pair were either the same person's face (congruent) or different person's faces (incongruent), and were always both famous or both non-famous faces. Experiments were performed over 2 days: 1 day for a real tDCS session and another for a sham session as a control condition. In the sham session, a priming effect, reflected in the difference in amplitude of the late positive component (250-500 ms to target onset), was observed only in the famous prime condition. According to a previous study, this effect might indicate a subliminal semantic process [10]. Alternatively, a priming effect toward famous primes disappeared after tDCS stimulation. Our results suggested that a subliminal process might not be limited to processes in the occipital and temporal areas, but may proceed to the semantic level processed in prefrontal cortex."
"Does Prefrontal Cortex Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation Influence the Oxygen Uptake at Rest and Post-exercise?","International journal of sports medicine",2013,1279-86,,Array,Array,23592415,,"Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a noninvasive technique that modulates the excitability of neurons within the motor cortex (M1). Although the aftereffects of anodal tDCS on modulating cortical excitability have been described, there is limited data describing the outcomes of different tDCS intensities on intracortical circuits. To further elucidate the mechanisms underlying the aftereffects of M1 excitability following anodal tDCS, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to examine the effect of different intensities on cortical excitability and short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI). Using a randomized, counterbalanced, crossover design, with a one-week wash-out period, 14 participants (6 females and 8 males, 22-45 years) were exposed to 10 minutes of anodal tDCS at 0.8, 1.0, and 1.2 mA. TMS was used to measure M1 excitability and SICI of the contralateral wrist extensor muscle at baseline, immediately after and 15 and 30 minutes following cessation of anodal tDCS. Cortical excitability increased, whilst SICI was reduced at all time points following anodal tDCS. Interestingly, there were no differences between the three intensities of anodal tDCS on modulating cortical excitability or SICI. These results suggest that the aftereffect of anodal tDCS on facilitating cortical excitability is due to the modulation of synaptic mechanisms associated with long-term potentiation and is not influenced by different tDCS intensities."
"Semantic processing in subliminal face stimuli: an EEG and tDCS study.","Neuroscience letters",2013,1279-86,544,Array,Array,23587808,,"The visual processing of emotional faces is subserved by both a cortical and a subcortical route. To investigate the specific contribution of these two functional pathways, two groups of neurologically healthy humans were tested using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). In Experiment 1, participants received sham and active cathodal-inhibitory tDCS over the left occipital cortex, while, in control Experiment 2, participants received sham and active cathodal-inhibitory tDCS over the vertex, to exclude any unspecific effect of tDCS. After tDCS, participants performed a go/no-go task responding to happy or fearful target faces presented in the left visual field, while backwardly masked faces (emotionally congruent, incongruent, or neutral) were concurrently displayed in the right visual field. After both suppressing activity in the vertex (Experiment 2) and sham stimulation (Experiment 1 and 2) a reduction of reaction times was found for pairs of emotionally congruent stimuli. However, after suppressing the activity in the left occipital cortex, the congruency-dependent response facilitation disappeared, while a specific facilitative affect was evident when masked fearful faces were coupled with happy target faces. These results parallel the performances of hemianopic patients and suggest that when the occipital cortex is damaged or inhibited, and the visual processing for emotional faces is mainly dependent on the activation of the ""low road"" subcortical route, fearful faces represent the only visually processed stimuli capable of facilitating a behavioral response. This effect might reflect an adaptive mechanism implemented by the brain to quickly react to potential threats before their conscious identification."

Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive and safe technique that is able to durably modulate the activity of the underlying cerebral cortex, and is being tested in various medical indications. The results of small open studies using tDCS in migraine prophylaxis are conflicting, possibly because the optimal stimulation settings and the brain targets were not well chosen. We have previously shown that the cerebral cortex, especially the visual cortex, is hyperresponsive in migraine patients between attacks and provided evidence from evoked potential studies that this is due to a decreased cortical preactivation level. If one accepts this concept, anodal tDCS over the visual cortex may have therapeutic potentials in migraine prevention, as it is able to increase neuronal firing."

Stimulation polarity was reversed for these groups on the second day. The third (control) group of subjects received sham stimulation on both days. No improvements or decrements in contrast sensitivity relative to the same-day baseline were observed during real tDCS, nor was any within-session learning trend observed. However, task performance improved significantly from Day 1 to Day 2 for the participants who received cathodal tDCS on Day 1 and for the sham group. No such improvement was found for the participants who received anodal stimulation on Day 1, indicating that anodal tDCS blocked overnight consolidation of visual learning, perhaps through engagement of inhibitory homeostatic plasticity mechanisms or alteration of the signal-to-noise ratio within stimulated cortex.

The complexity of these tES models ranges from simple sphere-based models of the head to high-resolution anatomical reconstructions based on head-image scans. This review provides an up-to-date description and comparison of existing computational models of tES (primarily tDCS and ECT), focusing on the modeling approaches adopted in previous studies and their significant finding."
"Evidence for long-lasting subcortical facilitation by transcranial direct current stimulation in the cat.","The Journal of physiology",2013,21-35,591,Array,Array,23507876,"Pt 13","The main aim of the study was to examine the effects of transcranial polarization on neurons in two descending motor systems, rubro- and reticulospinal. Anodal DC current was applied through an electrode in contact with the skull over the contralateral sensori-motor cortex, against an electrode placed between the skull and the ipsilateral temporal muscles in deeply anaesthetized cats. Its effects were estimated from changes in descending volleys evoked by electrical stimuli applied in the red nucleus (RN), medial longitudinal fascicle (MLF; to reticulospinal fibres) and the pyramidal tract (PT; to corticospinal or corticoreticular fibres). The descending volleys were recorded from the surface of the spinal cord at a cervical level. Rubrospinal neurones were activated either directly or indirectly, via interpositorubral fibres. Reticulospinal neurons were likewise activated directly and indirectly, via other reticulospinal or corticospinal fibres. Transcranial polarization facilitated transsynaptic activation of both rubrospinal and reticulospinal neurons, shortening the latency of the indirect descending volleys and/or increasing them, Direct activation of descending axons was much less affected. The facilitation of all subcortical neurons examined was potentiated by repeated applications of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and outlasted the polarization by at least 1-2 h, replicating tDCS effects on indirect activation of cortical neurons. The results indicate that the beneficial effects of tDCS on motor performance in humans may be due to more efficient activation of not only cortical but also subcortical neuronal systems. Combined actions of tDCS on cortical and subcortical neurones might thus further improve recovery of motor functions during rehabilitation after central injuries. 249/250."

Revue canadienne de psychiatrie",2013,1695-706,58,Array,Array,17251360,2,"Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) is a promising tool for modulating brain oscillations, as well as a possible therapeutic intervention. However, the lack of conclusive evidence on whether tACS is able to effectively affect cortical activity continues to limit its application. The present study aims to address this issue by exploiting the well-known inhibitory alpha rhythm in the posterior parietal cortex during visual perception and attention orientation. Four groups of healthy volunteers were tested with a Gabor patch detection and discrimination task. All participants were tested at the baseline and selective frequencies of tACS, including Sham, 6 Hz, 10 Hz, and 25 Hz. Stimulation at 6 Hz and 10 Hz over the occipito-parietal area impaired performance in the detection task compared to the baseline. The lack of a retinotopically organised effect and marginal frequency-specificity modulation in the detection task force us to be cautious about the effectiveness of tACS in modulating brain oscillations. Therefore, the present study does not provide significant evidence for tACS reliably inducing direct modulations of brain oscillations that can influence performance in a visual task."

Research on the neuroscience of anger has revealed that greater left than right frontal cortical activity is associated with angry approach-oriented responses, such as aggression, whereas greater right than left frontal cortical activity is associated with inhibited angry responses mixed with anxiety. In the current research, we extended these past studies by manipulating asymmetric frontal cortical activity using transcranial direct current stimulation and assessing its influence on ruminative responses to an interpersonal insult. Results revealed that self-reported rumination was greatest for participants who received a manipulated increase in relative right frontal cortical activity compared with those who received either a manipulated increase in relative left frontal cortical activity or sham stimulation. Taken together with past findings, the current results suggest that anger associated with greater relative left frontal cortical activity predicts approach-oriented aggressive action, whereas anger associated with greater relative right frontal cortical activity predicts inhibited rumination."
"Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) for catatonic schizophrenia: a case study.","Schizophrenia research",2013,1695-706,146,Array,Array,17706433,1-3,"BACKGROUND: The temporal and insular cortex (TC, IC) have been associated with autonomic nervous system (ANS) control and the awareness of emotional feelings from the body. Evidence shows that the ANS and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) regulate exercise performance. Non-invasive brain stimulation can modulate the cortical area directly beneath the electrode related to ANS and RPE, but it could also affect subcortical areas by connection within the cortico-cortical neural networks. This study evaluated the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the TC on the ANS, RPE and performance during a maximal dynamic exercise. METHODS: Ten trained cyclists participated in this study (33±9 years; 171.5±5.8 cm; 72.8±9.5 kg; 10-11 training years). After 20-min of receiving either anodal tDCS applied over the left TC (T3) or sham stimulation, subjects completed a maximal incremental cycling exercise test. RPE, heart rate (HR) and R-R intervals (as a measure of ANS function) were recorded continuously throughout the tests. Peak power output (PPO) was recorded at the end of the tests. RESULTS: With anodal tDCS, PPO improved by ∼4% (anodal tDCS: 313.2±29.9 vs 301.0±19.8 watts: sham tDCS; p=0.043), parasympathetic vagal withdrawal was delayed (anodal tDCS: 147.5±53.3 vs 125.0±35.4 watts: sham tDCS; p=0.041) and HR was reduced at submaximal workloads. RPE also increased more slowly during exercise following anodal tDCS application, but maximal RPE and HR values were not affected by cortical stimulation. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that non-invasive brain stimulation over the TC modulates the ANS activity and the sensory perception of effort and exercise performance, indicating that the brain plays a crucial role in the exercise performance regulation."

We searched PubMed and Scholars Portal using search terms related to schizophrenia, brain stimulation, and neuroplasticity. Various brain stimulation approaches simulating a range of experimental protocols that induce synaptic long-term potentiation or depression have been developed. By far, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been the most widely used in the field of schizophrenia. Its application has been associated with mixed results in treating treatment-resistant symptoms and cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia. Compared to the other approaches, rTMS is probably the least similar to plasticity-inducing cellular paradigms. Other approaches, such as paired associative stimulation, theta-burst stimulation, and transcranial direct current stimulation, are in their incipient stages in the study and treatment of schizophrenia, with promising early results. Numerous brain stimulation approaches have been developed to treat resistant dimensions of schizophrenia.

In three healthy adults, Transcranial Electrical Stimulation (TES) over primary motor cortex (M1) was delivered using the 4 × 1 montage (4 × cathode, surrounding a single central anode; montage radius ~3 cm) with sufficient intensity to elicit a discrete muscle twitch in the hand. The estimated current distribution in M1 was calculated using the individualized MRI-based model, and compared with the observed motor response across subjects. The response magnitude was quantified with stimulation over motor cortex as well as anterior and posterior to motor cortex. In each case the model data were consistent with the motor response across subjects. The estimated cortical electric fields with the 4 × 1 montage were compared (area, magnitude, direction) for TES and tDCS in each subject. We provide direct evidence in humans that TES with a 4 × 1-Ring configuration can activate motor cortex and that current does not substantially spread outside the stimulation area. Computational models predict that both TES and tDCS waveforms using the 4 × 1-Ring configuration generate electric fields in cortex with comparable gross current distribution, and preferentially directed normal (inward) currents. The agreement of modeling and experimental data for both current delivery and focality support the use of the HD-tDCS 4 × 1-Ring montage for cortically targeted neuromodulation."

In addition to being used as a tool for cognitive neuroscience investigations, tDCS has generated considerable interest for use as a therapeutic modality for neurologic disorders. Though the safety and tolerability of tDCS in adults is well-established, there is little information on the safety of tDCS in children. Because there are differences between children and adults in several key parameters (such as skull thickness and cerebrospinal fluid volume) which affect current flow through the brain, special consideration should be given to the stimulation parameters which are used in a pediatric study population. In this study we present cortical electrical field maps at different stimulation intensities and electrode configurations using a high-resolution-MRI derived finite element model of a typically developing, anatomically normal 12 year old child. The peak electrical fields for a given stimulus intensity in the adolescent brain were twice as high as in the adult brain for conventional tDCS and nearly four times as high for a 4X1 High-Definition tDCS electrode configuration.

TMS can be applied simultaneously with tDCS to probe brain excitability or to effect synergistic neuromodulation. Delivering TMS simultaneously with tDCS can induce electric current pulses in the tDCS electrodes even when the tDCS device is turned off or is set to 0 mA output, as long as the electrodes are connected to the tDCS current source. The output impedance of commercial tDCS devices is in the range of 2-5 kΩ which can allow substantial currents to be induced by TMS. In a rat TMS-tDCS setup, the induced currents are comparable to the tDCS current magnitude. To mitigate the induced currents, the area of the loop formed by the tDCS electrode leads should be minimized and the impedance of the tDCS circuit at TMS pulses frequencies (1-10 kHz) should be maximized."

Conference",2012,859-62,2012,Array,Array,22037128,,"Numerical modeling studies remain the only viable way to accurately predict the electric field (E-field) distribution in transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Despite the existence of multiple studies of this kind, a wide range of different values and properties for the electrical conductivities of the tissues represented is employed. This makes it difficult to predict whether the changes observed between models are due to differences in the geometries of the volume conductors or to the different electrical properties of the tissues. In this study we used the finite element method to calculate the E-field distribution in several spherical head models whose tissues were represented with different isotropic and anisotropic conductivity profiles. Results show that the distribution of the E-field is especially sensitive to the conductivity of the skull, skin and GM. These results might help comparing numerical modeling studies that employ different conductivity values."

Conference",2012,859-62,2012,Array,Array,21613470,,"High-Definition transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (HD-tDCS) using specialized small electrodes has been proposed as a focal, non-invasive neuromodulatory technique. Here we provide the first evidence of a change in cortical excitability after HD-tDCS of the motor cortex, using TMS motor evoked potential (MEP) as the measure of excitability. Stimulation for 20 minutes at 1 mA with an anode centered over the hand area of the motor cortex and four surrounding return electrodes (anodal 4×1 montage) produced a significant increase in MEP amplitude and variability after stimulation, compared to sham stimulation. Stimulation was well tolerated by all subjects with adverse effects limited to transient sensation under the electrodes. A high-resolution computational model confirmed predictions of increased focality using the 4×1 HD tDCS montage compared to conventional tDCS. Simulations also indicated that variability in placement of the center electrode relative to the location of the target (central sulcus) could account for increasing variability. These results provide support for the careful use of this technique where focal tDCS is desired."

Previous studies have demonstrated that anodal and cathodal stimulation can improve motor performance in terms of dexterity and manual force. The objective of this study was to determine whether different electrodes' setups (anodal, cathodal, and simultaneous bilateral tDCS) provide different motor performance and which montage was more effective. As secondary outcome, we have asked to the patients about their satisfaction, and to determine if the bilateral tDCS was more uncomfortable than unilateral tDCS. Nine patients with stroke in subacute phase were enrolled in this study and randomly divided in three groups. Our results showed that tDCS was an effective treatment if compared to Sham stimulation (P = 0.022). In particular, anodal stimulation provided the higher improvement in terms of manual dexterity. Cathodal stimulation seemed to have a little effect in terms of force improvement, not observed with other setups. Bipolar stimulation seemed to be the less effective. No significant differences have been noted for the different set-ups for patients' judgment. These results highlight the potential efficacy of tDCS for patients with stroke in subacute phase."
"Review of transcranial direct current stimulation in poststroke recovery.","Topics in stroke rehabilitation",,859-62,20,Array,Array,22032743,1,"Motor impairment, dysphagia, aphasia, and visual impairment are common disabling residual deficits experienced by stroke survivors. Recently, many novel rehabilitative modalities have been investigated for their potential to ameliorate such deficits and to improve functional outcomes. Noninvasive brain stimulation techniques, such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), have emerged as a promising tool to facilitate stroke recovery. tDCS can alter cortical excitability to induce brain plasticity by modulating the lesioned, contralesional, or bilateral hemispheres with various stimulation modalities. Along with peripheral therapies, tDCS can lead to subsequent sustained behavioral and clinical gains in patients with stroke. In this review, we summarize characteristics of tDCS (method of stimulation, safety profile, and mechanism) and its application in the treatment of various stroke-related deficits, and we highlight future directions for tDCS in this capacity."

Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a promising approach for improving motor learning. The aim of this trial was to test the hypothesis that dual-tDCS applied bilaterally over the primary motor cortices (M1) improves online motor skill learning with the paretic hand and its long-term retention. Methods: Eighteen chronic stroke patients participated in a randomized, cross-over, placebo-controlled, double bind trial. During separate sessions, dual-tDCS or sham dual-tDCS was applied over 30 min while stroke patients learned a complex visuomotor skill with the paretic hand: using a computer mouse to move a pointer along a complex circuit as quickly and accurately as possible. A learning index involving the evolution of the speed/accuracy trade-off was calculated. Performance of the motor skill was measured at baseline, after intervention and 1 week later. Results: After sham dual-tDCS, eight patients showed performance worsening. In contrast, dual-tDCS enhanced the amount and speed of online motor skill learning compared to sham (p < 0.001) in all patients; this superiority was maintained throughout the hour following. The speed/accuracy trade-off was shifted more consistently after dual-tDCS (n = 10) than after sham (n = 3). More importantly, 1 week later, online enhancement under dual-tDCS had translated into superior long-term retention (+44%) compared to sham (+4%). The improvement generalized to a new untrained circuit and to digital dexterity. Conclusion: A single-session of dual-tDCS, applied while stroke patients trained with the paretic hand significantly enhanced online motor skill learning both quantitatively and qualitatively, leading to successful long-term retention and generalization. The combination of motor skill learning and dual-tDCS is promising for improving post-stroke neurorehabilitation."

Two forms of low-intensity cranial electrical stimulation exist for clinical and research purposes: transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS). In a recent study, it was demonstrated that a single session of tDCS over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) (anode over right DLPFC) yields a transient improvement in subjects with chronic tinnitus and that repeated sessions can possibly be used as a treatment. In the present study, the effect of a single-session individual alpha-modulated tACS and tDCS applied at the DLPFC bilaterally is compared with tinnitus loudness and tinnitus annoyance. A total of fifty tinnitus patients were selected and randomly assigned to the tACS or tDCS treatment. Our main result was that bifrontal tDCS modulates tinnitus annoyance and tinnitus loudness, whereas individual alpha-modulated tACS does not yield a similar result. This study provides additional insights into the role of DLPFC in tinnitus modulation as well as the intersection between tinnitus and affective/attentional processing."

Given the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on neuroplasticity, the current study tested whether tDCS, using different electrode montages, can increase the neuroplastic effects of mental imagery on motor learning. Eighteen healthy right-handed adults underwent a randomised sham-controlled crossover experiment to receive mental training combined with either sham or active anodal tDCS of the right primary motor cortex (M1), right supplementary motor area, right premotor area, right cerebellum or left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Motor performance was assessed by a blinded rater using: non-dominant handwriting time and legibility, and mentally trained task at baseline (pre) and immediately after (post) mental practice combined with tDCS. Active tDCS significantly enhances the motor-imagery-induced improvement in motor function as compared with sham tDCS. There was a specific effect for the site of stimulation such that effects were only observed after M1 and DLPFC stimulation during mental practice. These findings provide new insights into motor imagery training and point out that two cortical targets (M1 and DLPFC) are significantly associated with the neuroplastic effects of mental imagery on motor learning. Further studies should explore a similar paradigm in patients with brain lesions."

We investigated this issue using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a method that non-invasively increases/decreases cortical activity. Twenty-eight age- and gender-matched, antidepressant-free depressed subjects received a single-session of active/sham tDCS. We used a bifrontal setup - anode and cathode over the left and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), respectively. The probabilistic classification-learning (PCL) task was administered before and during tDCS. The percentage of correct responses improved during sham; although not during active tDCS. Procedural or implicit learning acquisition between tasks also occurred only for sham. We discuss whether DLPFC activation decreased activity in subcortical structures due to the depressive state. The deactivation of the right DLPFC by cathodal tDCS can also account for our results. To conclude, active bifrontal tDCS prevented implicit learning in depressive patients. Further studies with different tDCS montages and in other samples are necessary."

"Assessment of electric field distribution in anisotropic cortical and subcortical regions under the influence of tDCS.",Bioelectromagnetics,2013,,,Array,Array,24122951,,"The focus of this study is to estimate the contribution of regional anisotropic conductivity on the spatial distribution of an induced electric field across gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), and subcortical regions under transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). The assessment was conducted using a passive high-resolution finite element head model with inhomogeneous and variable anisotropic conductivities derived from the diffusion tensor data. Electric field distribution was evaluated across different cortical as well as subcortical regions under four bicephalic electrode configurations. Results indicate that regional tissue heterogeneity and anisotropy cause the pattern of induced fields to vary in orientation and strength when compared to the isotropic scenario. Different electrode montages resulted in distinct distribution patterns with noticeable variations in field strengths. The effect of anisotropy is highly montage dependent and directional conductivity has a more profound effect in defining the strength of the induced field. The inclusion of anisotropy in the GM and subcortical regions has a significant effect on the strength and spatial distribution of the induced electric field. Under the (C3-Fp2) montage, the inclusion of GM and subcortical anisotropy increased the average percentage difference in the electric field strength of brain from 5% to 34% (WM anisotropy only). In terms of patterns distribution, the topographic errors increased from 9.9% to 40% (WM anisotropy only) across the brain. Bioelectromagnetics 9999:1-17. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

In this study, a stable deficit for detecting and orienting to visual stimuli presented in the contralesional visual hemifield was generated by producing unilateral brain damage of the right posterior parietal and contiguous visual cortical areas. A long regimen of inhibitory non-invasive transcranial direct-current stimulation (cathodal tDCS, 2 mA, 20 min) was applied to the contralateral (intact) posterior parietal cortex over 14 weeks (total of 70 sessions, one per day, 5 days per week) and behavioral outcomes were periodically assessed.

Recovery started after 2-3 weeks of stimulation, and recovered targets were located first in the periphery, and moved to more central visual field locations with the accrual of stimulation sessions. Recovery for moving tasks followed a biphasic pattern before reaching plateau levels. Recovery did not occur for more difficult visual tasks.

Yet, to date, most addiction treatments have demonstrated only limited success in reducing addiction-related behaviors. Accumulating and compelling evidence suggests that novel nonsurgical brain stimulation techniques, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial direct current stimulation, could serve as promising tools for indexing altered neurotransmission associated with repetitive drug use, and moreover, may hold therapeutic potential for the treatment of drug dependence and addiction-related behaviors.

"Noninvasive brain stimulation in neurorehabilitation.","Handbook of clinical neurology",2013,,116,Array,Array,24112919,,"Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has been used extensively to characterize motor system pathophysiology in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other forms of dementia, as well to monitor the effects of certain pharmacological agents. Among the studies focusing on motor cortical excitability measures, the most consistent finding is a significant reduction of short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI) in AD and other forms of dementia in which the cholinergic system is affected, such as dementia with Lewy bodies. SAI evaluation may thus provide a reliable biomarker of cortical cholinergic dysfunction in dementias. Moreover, most TMS studies have demonstrated cortical hyperexcitability and asymptomatic motor cortex functional reorganization in the early stages of the disease. Integrated approaches utilizing TMS together with high-density EEG have indicated impaired cortical plasticity and functional connectivity across different neural networks in AD. Paired associative stimulation-induced plasticity has also been found to be abnormal in patients with AD. The development of novel noninvasive methods of brain stimulation, in particular repetitive TMS (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), has increased the interest in neuromodulatory techniques as potential therapeutic tools for cognitive rehabilitation in AD.

With greater time-on-task the ability to detect targets decreases and reaction time increases-a phenomenon termed the vigilance decrement. The purpose of this study was to examine the role of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in the vigilance decrement. Subjects (n=19) received prefrontal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) at one of two different time points during a vigilance task (early or late). The impact of tDCS was examined using measures of behavior, hemispheric blood flow velocity, and regional blood oxygenation relative to sham stimulation. In the sham condition greater time-on-task was accompanied by fewer target detections and slower reaction times, indicating a vigilance decrement, and decreased blood flow velocity. tDCS significantly altered baseline task-induced physiologic and behavioral changes, dependent on the time of stimulation administration and electrode configuration (determining polarity of stimulation). Compared to the sham condition, with more time-on-task blood flow velocity decreased less and cerebral oxygenation increased more in the tDCS condition. Behavioral measures showed a significant improvement in target detection performance with tDCS compared to the sham stimulation. Signal detection analysis revealed a significant change in operator discriminability and response bias with increased time-on-task, as well as interactions between time of stimulation administration and electrode configuration. Current density modeling of tDCS showed high densities in the medial prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex. These findings confirm that cerebral hemodynamic measures provide an index of resource utilization and point to the central role of the frontal cortex in vigilance. Further, they suggest that modulation of the frontal cortices-and connected structures-influences the availability of vigilance resources. These findings indicate that tDCS may be well-suited to mitigate performance degradation in work settings requiring sustained attention or as a possible treatment for neurological or psychiatric disorders involving sustained attention."

High contrast and low contrast stimuli were presented as a moving grating in his blind hemifield. When left area MT/V5 was anodally stimulated during the presentation of high-contrast gratings, he never reported a phenomenal percept of a moving grating but showed perfect blindsight performance. When applied along with low contrast gratings, for which accuracy was titrated to 60-70 %, performance did not improve but responses were significantly faster. Cathodal stimulation had no effect. Results are explained in the framework of GY's reorganized cortical connexions and oscillatory patterns known to be involved in awareness in GY.

"Anodal transcranial direct current stimulation modulates GABAB-related intracortical inhibition in the M1 of healthy individuals.",Neuroreport,2013,46-50,24,Array,Array,23196416,1,"It is known that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can induce polarity-specific shifts in brain excitability of the primary motor cortex (M1) with anodal tDCS enhancing and cathodal tDCS reducing cortical excitability. However, less is known about its impact on specific intracortical inhibitory mechanisms, such as γ-aminobutyric acid B (GABAB)-mediated inhibition. Consequently, the aim of the present study was to assess the impact of anodal and cathodal tDCS on M1 intracortical inhibition in healthy individuals. Long-interval intracortical inhibition (LICI) and cortical silent period (CSP) duration, both presumably mediated by GABAB receptors, were assessed using transcranial magnetic stimulation immediately before and after a 20 min session of tDCS over the left M1. Anodal tDCS significantly enhanced motor evoked potential size and reduced CSP duration, whereas it had no effect on LICI. Cathodal stimulation did not significantly modulate motor evoked potential size, CSP duration or LICI. This study provides evidence that anodal tDCS, presumably by synaptic plasticity mechanisms, has a direct effect on GABAB-meditated inhibition assessed by the CSP, but not by LICI. Our results further suggest that CSP and LICI probe distinct intracortical inhibitory mechanisms as they are differentially modulated by anodal tDCS. Finally, these data may have clinical value in patients in whom a pathological increase in CSP duration is present, such as schizophrenia."

The present study investigated the effect of a single session of anodal, cathodal and sham stimulation (15 mins/1 mA) over the primary motor cortex on the perceived intensity of repeated noxious thermal and electrical stimuli and on elements of quantitative sensory testing (thermal pain and perception thresholds) applied to the right hand in 15 patients with chronic low back pain. The study was conducted in a double-blind sham-controlled and cross-over design. No significant alterations of pain ratings were found. Modalities of quantitative sensory testing remained equally unchanged. It is therefore hypothesized that a single 15 mins session of tDCS at 1 mA may not be sufficient to alter the perception of experimental pain and in patients with chronic pain. Further studies applying repetitive tDCS to patients with chronic pain are required to fully answer the question whether experimental pain perception may be influenced by tDCS over the motor cortex."

Previous studies suggest that the rIPS is especially involved in top-down control and spatial distribution of attention across both visual hemifields. We further explored these attentional functions using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the rIPS to modulate behavioral performance in a partial report task. Performance was analyzed according to the theory of visual attention (TVA) (Bundesen, 1990), which provides a computational framework to investigate different parameters of visuo-attentional processing such as top-down control, attentional weighting, capacity of visual short term memory, and processing speed. We investigated the effects of different tDCS current strengths (1 mA and 2 mA) in two experiments: 1 mA tDCS (anodal, cathodal, sham) did not affect any of the TVA parameters, but cathodal 2 mA stimulation significantly enhanced top-down control as evidenced by a reduction of the α parameter of TVA, regardless of hemifield. This differential impact on the top-down control component of attentional processing suggests that the horizontal rIPS is mainly involved in attentional selection as none of the spatial or resource variables of TVA were altered. Furthermore, the data add evidence to previous work highlighting (1) the importance of using appropriate current strength in stimulation protocols, and (2) that the often reported inhibitory effect of cathodal stimulation in e.g., motor tasks might not extend to cognitive paradigms."

When an encoded memory is recalled, it becomes labile and another round of consolidation, or reconsolidation, is required to restore its stability. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive method of altering cortical excitability. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of tDCS on the reconsolidation of long-term verbal memory. Participants (n = 15) memorized words in the encoding session, then reactivated the memory of the words 3 h later using an old-new recognition task under anodal, cathodal and sham stimulation to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Finally, after another 5 h, they performed another round of the old-new recognition task and rated their confidence. Anodal tDCS during the second session resulted in significantly more words recognized in the third session as compared to cathodal and sham stimulation. Cathodal tDCS did not affect the recognition performance compared to sham stimulation. These results cannot be attributed to differences in response times and confidence ratings, as they were comparable in all conditions. In order to study whether the activation of a memory was crucial for the enhancing effects of anodal tDCS, a group of controls (n = 15) did not perform the recognition task in the second session but still underwent stimulation. Contrary to the main group, anodal stimulation did not enhance the memory performance for the control group. This result suggests that anodal tDCS over the left DLPFC can enhance the reconsolidation of long-term memory only when the memory has been reactivated."
"Eyelid myokymia in an older subject after repetitive sessions of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation.","Brain stimulation",2013,668-74,6,Array,Array,23137701,3,"In various studies nicotine has shown to alter cognitive functions in non-smoking subjects. The physiological basis for these effects might be nicotine-generated modulation of cortical structure, excitability, and activity, as mainly described in animal experiments. In accordance, a recently conducted study demonstrated that application of nicotine for hours via nicotine patch in non-smoking humans alters the effects of neuroplasticity-inducing non-invasive brain stimulation techniques on cortical excitability. Specifically, nicotine abolished inhibitory plasticity independent from the focality of the stimulation protocol. While nicotine prevented also the establishment of non-focal facilitatory plasticity, focal synapse-specific facilitatory plasticity was enhanced. These results agree with a focusing effect of prolonged nicotine application on facilitatory plasticity. However, since nicotine induces rapid adaption processes of its receptors, this scenario might differ from the effect of nicotine in cigarette smoking. Thus in this study we aimed to gain further insight in the mechanism of nicotine on plasticity by exploring the effect of nicotine spray on non-focal and focal plasticity-inducing protocols in non-smoking subjects, a fast-acting agent better comparable to cigarette smoking. Focal, synapse-specific plasticity was induced by paired associative stimulation (PAS), while non-focal plasticity was elicited by transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Forty eight non-smokers received nicotine spray respectively placebo combined with one of the following protocols (anodal tDCS, cathodal tDCS, PAS-25, and PAS-10). Corticospinal excitability was monitored via motor-evoked potentials elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Nicotine spray abolished facilitatory plasticity irrespective of focality and PAS-10-induced excitability diminution, while tDCS-derived excitability reduction was delayed and weakened. Nicotine spray had thus a clear effect on neuroplasticity in non-smoking subjects. However, the effects of nicotine spray differ clearly from those of prolonged nicotine application, which might be due to missing adaptive nicotinic receptor alterations. These results enhance our knowledge about the dynamic impact of nicotine on plasticity, which might be related to its heterogenous effect on cognition."

However, the passage of current through the body may interfere with the concurrent detection of blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal, which is sensitive to local magnetic fields. To test whether these currents can affect concurrent fMRI recordings we performed conventional gradient echo-planar imaging (EPI) during transcranial direct current (tDCS) and alternating current stimulation (tACS) on two post-mortem subjects. tDCS induced signals in both superficial and deep structures. The signal was specific to the electrode montage, with the strongest signal near cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and scalp.

High-resolution individualized modeling of current flow and induced static magnetic fields suggested a strong coincidence of the change EPI signal with regions of large current density and magnetic fields. These initial results indicate that (1) fMRI studies of tDCS must consider this potentially confounding interference from current flow and (2) conventional MRI imaging protocols can be potentially used to measure current flow during transcranial electrical stimulation.

One potential source of variability is the intensity of current delivered to the brain which is a function of both the operator controlled tDCS dose (electrode montage and total applied current) and subject specific anatomy. We are interested in both the scale of this variability across anatomical typical adults and methods to normalize inter-individual variation by customizing tDCS dose. Computational FEM simulations are a standard technique to predict brain current flow during tDCS and can be based on subject specific anatomical MRI. Objective: To investigate this variability, we modeled multiple tDCS montages across three adults (ages 34-41, one female). Results: Conventional pad stimulation led to diffuse modulation with maximum current flow between the pads across all subjects. There was high current flow directly under the pad for one subject while the location of peak induced cortical current flow was variable. The High-Definition tDCS montage led to current flow restricted to within the ring perimeter across all subjects. The current flow profile across all subjects and montages was influenced by details in cortical gyri/sulci. Conclusion: This data suggests that subject specific modeling can facilitate consistent and more efficacious tDCS."

Yet, concurrent application of tDCS/NMES may also activate homeostatic mechanisms that block or reverse effects on corticomotor excitability. It is unknown how tDCS and NMES interact in the human primary motor cortex (M1) and whether effects are summative (increase corticomotor excitability beyond that of tDCS or NMES applied alone) or competitive (block or reduce corticomotor excitability effects of tDCS or NMES applied alone)."

The effects of tDCS may be inhibitory or excitatory, depending on the relative polarities of electrodes and their proximity to different brain structures. This distinction is believed to relate to the interaction of current flow with activation thresholds of different neural complexes. tDCS currents are typically applied via a single pair of large electrodes, with one (the active electrode) sited close to brain structures associated with targeted processes. To efficiently direct current toward the areas presumed related to these effects, we devised a method of steering current toward a selected area by reference to a 19-electrode montage applied to a high-resolution finite element model of the head. We used a non-linear optimization procedure to maximize mean current densities inside the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), while simultaneously restricting overall current, and median current densities within the accumbens. We found that a distributed current pattern could be found that would indeed direct current toward the IFG in this way, and compared it to other candidate 2-electrode configurations. Further, we found a combination of four anterior-posterior electrodes could direct current densities to the accumbens. We conclude that a similar method using multiple electrodes may be a useful means of directing current toward or away from specific brain regions and also of reducing tDCS side effects."
"Non-invasive cerebral stimulation for the upper limb rehabilitation after stroke: a review.","Annals of physical and rehabilitation medicine",2012,234-6,55,Array,Array,22037126,9-10,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) and cardiovascular diseases are intimately associated. Depression is an independent risk factor for mortality in cardiovascular samples. Neuroendocrine dysfunctions in MDD are related to an overactive hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and increased sympathetic activity. Novel intervention strategies for MDD include the non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). In fact, although these techniques have being increasingly used as a treatment for MDD, their cardiovascular effects were not sufficiently investigated, which would be important considering the dyad MDD/cardiovascular disorders. We investigated this issue through a systematic review for published articles from the first date available to May 2012 in MEDLINE and other databases, looking for main risk factors and surrogate markers for cardiovascular disease such as: cortisol, heart rate variability (HRV), alcohol, smoking, obesity, hypertension, glucose. We identified 37 articles (981 subjects) according to our eligibility criteria. Our main findings were that NIBS techniques might be effective strategies for down-regulating HPA activity and regulating food, alcohol, and cigarette consumption. NIBS's effects on HRV and blood pressure presented mixed findings, with studies suggesting that HRV values can decrease or remain unchanged after NIBS, while one study found that rTMS increased blood pressure levels. Also, a single study showed that glucose levels decrease after tDCS. However, most studies tested the acute effects after one single session of rTMS/tDCS; therefore further studies are necessary to investigate whether NIBS modifies cardiovascular risk factors in the long-term. In fact, considering the burden of cardiac disease, further trials in cardiovascular, depressed, and non-depressed samples using NIBS should be performed."

Cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation can temporarily reduce motor cortex excitability. To test whether stimulation of the motor cortex can reduce dystonic symptoms in children, we measured tracking performance and muscle overflow using an electromyogram tracking task before and after stimulation. Of 10 participants, 3 showed a significant reduction in overflow, and a fourth showed a significant reduction in tracking error. Overflow decreased more when the hand contralateral to the cathode performed the task than when the hand ipsilateral to the cathode performed the task. Averaged over all participants, the results did not reach statistical significance. These results suggest that cathodal stimulation may allow a subset of children to control muscles or reduce involuntary overflow activity. Further testing is needed to confirm these results in a blinded trial and identify the subset of children who are likely to respond."

However, there is no experiment on the effects of tDCS on color perception to date. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of tDCS on color discrimination tasks. Fifteen healthy subjects (mean age of 25.6 ± 4.4 years) were tested with Cambridge Color Test 2.0 (Trivector and ellipses protocols) and a Forced-choice Spatial Color Contrast Sensitivity task (vertical red-green sinusoidal grating) while receiving tDCS. Anodal, cathodal, and sham tDCS were delivered at Oz for 22 min using two square electrodes (25 cm(2) with a current of 1.5 mA) in sessions separated by 7 days. Anodal tDCS significantly increased tritan sensitivity (p < 0.01) and had no significant effect on protan, deutan, or red-green grating discrimination. The effects on the tritan discrimination returned to baseline after 15 min (p < 0.01). Cathodal tDCS reduced the sensitivity in the deutan axis and increased sensitivity in the tritan axis (p < 0.05). The lack of anodal tDCS effects in the protan, deutan, and red-green grating sensitivities could be explained by a ""ceiling effect"" since adults in this age range tend to have optimal color discrimination performance for these hues. The differential effects of cathodal tDCS on tritan and deutan sensitivities and the absence of the proposed ceiling effects for the tritan axes might be explained by Parvocellular (P) and Koniocellular (K) systems with regard to their functional, physiological, and anatomical differences.

"Transcranial direct current stimulation and behavioral models of smoking addiction.","Frontiers in psychiatry",2012,535-41,3,Array,Array,18952147,,"The nature of parietal contributions to working memory (WM) remain poorly understood but of considerable interest. We previously reported that posterior parietal damage selectively impaired WM probed by recognition (Berryhill and Olson, 2008a). Recent studies provided support using a neuromodulatory technique, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) applied to the right parietal cortex (P4). These studies confirmed parietal involvement in WM because parietal tDCS altered WM performance: anodal current tDCS improved performance in a change detection task, and cathodal current tDCS impaired performance on a sequential presentation task. Here, we tested whether these complementary results were due to different degrees of parietal involvement as a function of WM task demands, WM task difficulty, and/or participants' WM capacity. In Experiment 1, we applied cathodal and anodal tDCS to the right parietal cortex and tested participants on both previously used WM tasks. We observed an interaction between tDCS (anodal, cathodal), WM task difficulty, and participants' WM capacity. When the WM task was difficult, parietal stimulation (anodal or cathodal) improved WM performance selectively in participants with high WM capacity. In the low WM capacity group, parietal stimulation (anodal or cathodal) impaired WM performance. These nearly equal and opposite effects were only observed when the WM task was challenging, as in the change detection task. Experiment 2 probed the interplay of WM task difficulty and WM capacity in a parametric manner by varying set size in the WM change detection task. Here, the effect of parietal stimulation (anodal or cathodal) on the high WM capacity group followed a linear function as WM task difficulty increased with set size. The low WM capacity participants were largely unaffected by tDCS. These findings provide evidence that parietal involvement in WM performance depends on both WM capacity and WM task demands. We discuss these findings in terms of alternative WM strategies employed by low and high WM capacity individuals. We speculate that low WM capacity individuals do not recruit the posterior parietal lobe for WM tasks as efficiently as high WM capacity individuals. Consequently, tDCS provides greater benefit to individuals with high WM capacity."

Imaging and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation studies suggest that increased dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) activation and integrity may be associated with increased resistance to smoking cues. Anodal tDCS of the DLPFC, believed to boost activation, reduces cravings in response to these cues. The finding that noninvasive stimulation modifies cue induced cravings has profound implications for understanding the processes underlying addiction and relapse. tDCS can also be applied to probe mechanisms underlying and supporting nicotine addiction, as was done in a pharmacologic study that applied nicotine, tDCS, and TMS paired associative stimulation to find that stopping nicotine after chronic use induces a reduction in plasticity, causing difficulty in breaking free from association between cues and cravings. This mini-review will place studies that apply tDCS to smokers in the context of research involving the neural substrates of nicotine addiction."

Because different electrode montages result in distinct brain current flow patterns across the brain, tDCS dose parameters can be adjusted, in an application-specific manner, to target or avoid specific brain regions. Though the tDCS electrode montage often follows basic rules of thumb (increased/decreased excitability ""under"" the anode/cathode electrode), computational forward models of brain current flow provide more accurate insight into detailed current flow patterns and, in some cases, can even challenge simplified electrode-placement assumptions. With the increased recognized value of computational forward models in informing tDCS montage design and interpretation of results, there have been recent advances in modeling tools and a greater proliferation of publications.  In addition, the importance of customizing tDCS for potentially vulnerable populations (eg, skull defects, brain damage/stroke, and extremes of age) can be considered. Finally, computational models can be used to design new electrode montages, for example, to improve spatial targeting such as high-definition tDCS. Pending further validation and dissemination of modeling tools, computational forward models of neuromodulation will become standard tools to guide the optimization of clinical trials and electrotherapy."

Abnormalities in these neurotransmitter systems can be demonstrated by changes in cortical excitability parameters assessed with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Furthermore, integrated approaches utilizing TMS combined with electroencephalography (EEG) enable the evaluation of the focal effects of alcohol on the human cortex, providing useful information, different from that obtained using other functional brain imaging modalities. Alcohol was found to modulate EEG responses evoked by motor-cortex TMS, predominantly at the right prefrontal cortex, indicating that ethanol alters the functional connectivity between motor and prefrontal areas. Alcohol decreases amplitudes of EEG responses of anterior parts of the cortex after left prefrontal TMS, suggesting a decrease of prefrontal cortical excitability. High-frequency repetitive TMS (rTMS) revealed significant changes in short-term plasticity of the primary motor cortex after acute ethanol intake and in patients with chronic alcohol abuse. TMS findings also support the recently emerged theory that abnormal function of glutamate receptors plays a relevant role in the development of alcohol dependence and manifestation of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Finally, initial studies provide evidence that non-invasive brain stimulation techniques (rTMS and transcranial direct current stimulation) might represent a potential therapeutic tool to reduce alcohol craving. Future studies with larger sample size evaluating the clinical effects of these neuromodulatory approaches are required to confirm and extend the preliminary findings."

These techniques are based on the delivery of weak currents through the scalp (with electrode current intensity to area ratios of about 0.3-5 A/m2) at low frequencies (typically < 1 kHz) resulting in weak electric fields in the brain (with amplitudes of about 0.2-2 V/m). Here we review the biophysics and simulation of noninvasive, current-controlled generation of electric fields in the human brain and the models for the interaction of these electric fields with neurons, including a survey of in vitro and in vivo related studies.

However, its neurobiological effects are still largely unknown. Electric fields are known to influence the migration of various cell types in vitro, but effects in vivo remain to be shown. Hypothesizing that tDCS might elicit the recruitment of cells to the cortex, we here studied the effects of tDCS in the rat brain in vivo. Adult Wistar rats (n = 16) were randomized to either anodal or cathodal stimulation for either 5 or 10 consecutive days (500 µA, 15 min). Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was given systemically to label dividing cells throughout the experiment. Immunohistochemical analyses ex vivo included stainings for activated microglia and endogenous neural stem cells (NSC). Multi-session tDCS with the chosen parameters did not cause a cortical lesion. An innate immune response with early upregulation of Iba1-positive activated microglia occurred after both cathodal and anodal tDCS. The involvement of adaptive immunity as assessed by ICAM1-immunoreactivity was less pronounced. Most interestingly, only cathodal tDCS increased the number of endogenous NSC in the stimulated cortex. After 10 days of cathodal stimulation, proliferating NSC increased by ∼60%, with a significant effect of both polarity and number of tDCS sessions on the recruitment of NSC. We demonstrate a pro-inflammatory effect of both cathodal and anodal tDCS, and a polarity-specific migratory effect on endogenous NSC in vivo. Our data suggest that tDCS in human stroke patients might also elicit NSC activation and modulate neuroinflammation."

The majority of previous controlled studies have used anodal stimulation to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and a control location such as the supraorbital region for the cathode. Several open-label studies have suggested effectiveness from anodal stimulation to the left DLPFC combined with cathodal stimulation to the right DLPFC. Thus, this study evaluated the efficacy of tDCS using anodal stimulation to the left DLPFC and cathodal stimulation to the right DLPFC compared to sham tDCS. Methods: Subjects between the ages of 18 and 65 were recruited from a tertiary care university hospital. Twenty-four subjects with TRD and a 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression greater than 21 were randomized to receive tDCS or sham tDCS. The rates of remission were compared between the two treatment groups. Results: The remission rates did not differ significantly between the two groups using an intention to treat analysis. More subjects in the active tDCS group had failed a course of electroconvulsive therapy in the current depressive episode. Side effects did not differ between the two groups and in general the treatment was very well tolerated. Conclusion: Anodal stimulation to the left DLPFC and cathodal stimulation to the right DLPFC was not efficacious in TRD. However, a number of methodological limitations warrant caution in generalizing from this study. Ongoing, controlled studies should provide further clarification on the efficacy of this stimulation configuration in TRD. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01078948."
"A randomized double-blind sham-controlled study of transcranial direct current stimulation for treatment-resistant major depression.","Frontiers in psychiatry",2012,192-9,3,Array,Array,19528092,,"Background: Word retrieval during verbal fluency tasks invokes both automatic and controlled cognitive processes. A distinction has been made between the generation of words clusters and switches between such clusters on verbal fluency tasks. Clusters, defined by the reporting of contiguous words that constitute semantic or phonemic subcategories, are thought to reflect relatively automatic processing. In contrast, switching from one subcategory to another is thought to require a more controlled, effortful form of cognitive processing. Objective: In this single-blind, sham-controlled experiment, we investigated whether anodal and cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can differentially modify controlled or automatic processes that support lexical retrieval, as assessed by clustering and switching on verbal fluency tasks, in 24 healthy right-handed adults. Methods: Participants were randomly assigned to receive 1 mA of either anodal (excitatory) or cathodal (inhibitory) active tDCS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in addition to sham stimulation over the same region in counterbalanced order. Participants engaged in various cognitive activities during the first 23 min of stimulation. Then, during the final segment of each 30-min session, they completed letter- and category-cued word fluency tasks. Results: Participants reported more words on category-cued word fluency tasks during anodal than sham stimulation (25.9 vs. 23.0 words; p = 0.055). They also showed a net increase in the number of clustered words during anodal stimulation compared to a net decrease during cathodal stimulation (1.3 vs. -1.5 words; p = 0.038). Conclusion: tDCS can selectively alter automatic aspects of speeded lexical retrieval in a polarity-dependent fashion during a category-guided fluency task."

"rTMS as a treatment for neurogenic communication and swallowing disorders.","Acta neurologica Scandinavica",2013,77-91,127,Array,Array,22881826,2,"Recent years have seen the introduction of non-invasive brain stimulation techniques (e.g. transcranial direct current stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation) utilized to target neural-based pathologies, for therapeutic gain. The direct manipulation of cortical brain activity by repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) could potentially serve as an efficacious complimentary rehabilitatory treatment for speech, language and swallowing disorders of a neurological origin. The high prevalence of positive reports on communication and swallowing outcomes support these premises. Nonetheless, experimental evidence to date in some areas is considered rudimentary and is deficient in providing placebo-controlled substantiation of longitudinal neuroplastic change subsequent to stimulation. The most affirmative therapeutic responses have arisen from small placebo-controlled trials using low-frequency rTMS for patients with non-fluent aphasia and high-frequency rTMS applied to individuals with Parkinson's disease to improve motor speech performance and outcomes. Preliminary studies applying rTMS to ameliorate dysphagic symptoms post-stroke provide positive swallowing outcomes for patients. Further research into the optimization of rTMS protocols, including dosage, stimulation targets for maximal efficacy and placebo techniques, is critically needed to provide a fundamental basis for clinical interventions using this technique. rTMS represents a highly promising and clinically relevant technique, warranting the future development of clinical trials across a spectrum of communication and swallowing pathologies, to substantiate and expand on the methods outlined in published reports."

In both experiments, participants were tested in two sessions in which either real or sham tDCS was delivered. We found that anodal tDCS over the left STG significantly increased the SI effect, whereas anodal tDCS over the left IFG led to a reduction of the SI effect. Overall, our data confirm the existence of a distributed cortical network involved in lexical retrieval and show that both the left IFG and the left STG play a causal role in this process. In particular, the left IFG is likely to be critical in resolving the conflict between competitor lexical representations, while the left STG seems to be the neural locus of the lexical representational system, where competition among different lexical representations occurs."
"Tinnitus: therapeutic use of superficial brain stimulation.","Handbook of clinical neurology",2013,441-67,116,Array,Array,24112915,,"Tinnitus is a common disorder and traditional treatment approaches such as medication, active or passive sound enhancement, and cognitive behavioral therapy have limited efficacy. Thus, there is an urgent need for more effective treatment approaches. Functional imaging studies in patients with tinnitus have revealed alterations in neuronal activity of central auditory pathways, probably resulting as a consequence of sensory deafferentation. However, nonauditory brain areas are also involved. These nonauditory brain areas might represent both an ""awareness"" network involved in the conscious perception of the tinnitus signal as well as areas related to a nontinnitus-specific distress network consisting of the anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula, and amygdala. Moreover, memory mechanisms involving the hippocampus and the parahippocampal region may play a role in the persistence of the awareness of the phantom percept, as well as in the reinforcement of the associated distress. All of these networks represent potential targets for treatment via pharmacological treatment or noninvasive and invasive brain stimulation. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a noninvasive method of applying electromagnetic fields to the brain that can induce alterations of neuronal activity that outlast the stimulation period. Single sessions of rTMS over the temporal or temporoparietal cortex have been successful in transiently reducing tinnitus perception. Repeated sessions of rTMS have resulted in tinnitus relief in a subgroup of patients, lasting from several days to several months. However, effect sizes of rTMS in the treatment of tinnitus are only moderate, and interindividual variability is high. Larger and longer lasting effects have been observed with direct electrical stimulation of the auditory cortex via implanted epidural electrodes. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has also shown potential for the treatment of tinnitus. Both auditory and frontal tDCS have shown tinnitus reduction in a subgroup of patients. In spite of the promising results of the different brain stimulation approaches, further research is needed before these techniques can be recommended for routine clinical use."
Pain.,"Handbook of clinical neurology",2013,441-67,116,Array,Array,24112914,,"Invasive stimulation of the motor (precentral) cortex using surgically implanted epidural electrodes is indicated for the treatment of neuropathic pain that is refractory to medical treatment. Controlled trials have demonstrated the efficacy of epidural motor cortex stimulation (MCS), but MCS outcome remains variable and validated criteria for selecting good candidates for implantation are lacking. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a noninvasive approach that could be used as a preoperative tool to predict MCS outcome and also could serve as a therapeutic procedure in itself to treat pain disorders. This requires repeated rTMS sessions and a maintenance protocol. Other studies have also demonstrated the efficacy of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in relieving chronic pain syndromes. The most studied target is the precentral cortex, but other targets, such as the prefrontal and parietal cortices, could be of interest. The analgesic effects of cortical stimulation relate to the activation of various circuits modulating neural activities in remote structures, such as the thalamus, limbic cortex, insula, or descending inhibitory controls. In addition to the treatment of refractory neuropathic pain by epidural MCS, new developments of this type of strategy are ongoing, for other types of pain syndrome and stimulation techniques."

"Impairments of motor-cortex responses to unilateral and bilateral direct current stimulation in schizophrenia.","Frontiers in psychiatry",2013,441-67,4,Array,Array,24109457,,"Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a kind of neuromodulation protocol, which transmits small amount of DC currents through scalp electrodes to facilitate or inhibit particular areas of the brain. Although many studies have demonstrated that tDCS can effectively modulate excitability of various brain sites, the outcomes of the tDCS treatment are not consistent among subjects to whom identical electrode montages were applied. So far, no studies have clearly elucidated the main cause of this individual variability. The hypothesis of our study was that the individual variability in the tDCS effect might be originated due to the anatomical differences among subjects. To verify our hypothesis, we investigated the relationship between the current density value at dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) simulated using finite element method (FEM) and the behavioral outcomes of a simple working memory (WM) task. A 3-back WM task experiment was conducted with twenty-five healthy subjects before and after the DC stimulation, when the cathode and anode electrodes were attached to right supraorbital area and F3 location, respectively, for all subjects. The results showed that participants who showed enhanced WM task performance after tDCS had a significantly larger current density on DLPFC, suggesting that the inconsistent behavioral outcomes of tDCS might be partially due to the anatomical differences among subjects."
"Predicting the behavioral impact of transcranial direct current stimulation: issues and limitations.","Frontiers in human neuroscience",2013,441-67,7,Array,Array,24109445,,"Planar electrodes are increasingly used in a variety of neural stimulation techniques such as epidural spinal cord stimulation, epidural cortical stimulation, transcranial direct current stimulation and functional electric stimulation. Recently, optimized electrode geometries have been shown to increase the efficiency of neural stimulation by maximizing the variation of current density on the electrode surface. In the present work, a new family of modified fractal electrode geometries is developed to increase the neural activation function and enhance the efficiency of neural stimulation. It is hypothesized that the key factor in increasing the activation function in the tissue adjacent to the electrode is to increase the ""edginess"" of the electrode surface, a concept that is explained and quantified by fractal mathematics. Rigorous finite element simulations were performed to compute the distribution of electric potential produced by proposed geometries, demonstrating that the neural activation function was significantly enhanced in the tissue. The activation of 800 model axons positioned around the electrodes was also quantified, showing that modified fractal geometries yielded a 22% reduction in input power consumption while maintaining the same level of neural activation. The results demonstrate the feasibility of increasing stimulation efficiency using modified fractal geometries beyond the levels already reported in the literature."

"Good vibrations: oscillatory phase shapes perception.",NeuroImage,2012,1006-12,63,Array,Array,22836177,2,"In the current study, we provide compelling evidence to answer the long-standing question whether perception is continuous or periodic. Spontaneous brain oscillations are assumed to be the underlying mechanism of periodic perception. Depending on the phase angle of the oscillations, an identical stimulus results in different perceptual outcomes. Past results, however, can only account for a correlation of perception with the phase of the ongoing brain oscillations. Therefore, it is desirable to demonstrate a causal relation between phase and perception. One way to address this question is to entrain spontaneous brain oscillations by applying an external oscillation and then demonstrate behavioral consequences of this oscillation. We conducted an auditory detection experiment with humans, recorded the electroencephalogram (EEG) concurrently and simultaneously applied oscillating transcranial direct current stimulation at 10Hz (α-tDCS). Our approach revealed that detection thresholds were dependent on the phase of the oscillation that was entrained by α-tDCS. This behavioral effect was accompanied by an electrophysiological effect: α-power was enhanced after α-tDCS as compared to a pre-stimulation period. By showing a causal relation between phase and perception, our results extend findings of previous studies that were only able to demonstrate a correlation. We found that manipulation of the phase resulted in different detection thresholds, which supports the notion that perception can be periodically modulated by oscillatory processes. This demonstrates that tDCS can serve as a tool in neuroscience to extend the knowledge of the functional significance of brain oscillations."

These techniques use noninvasive transcranial electrical or magnetic stimulation to modulate neurons activity in the human brain. Cortical stimulation might enhance or inhibit the activity of cortico-subcortical networks, depending on stimulus frequency and intensity, current polarity, and other stimulation parameters such as the configuration of the induced electric field and stimulation protocols. On this basis, in the last two decades, these techniques have rapidly become valuable tools to investigate physiology of the human brain and have been applied to treat drug-resistant neurological and psychiatric diseases.

This bias is thought to be driven by higher levels of activation in right parietal areas. Using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to manipulate activation, this study examined whether tDCS over the left and right posterior parietal cortices (PPC) affects pseudoneglect. Normal participants received tDCS over the left or right PPCs (15 in each group). Pseudoneglect was measured using the greyscales task, which requires a forced-choice discrimination of luminance between two opposing luminance gradients. The greyscales task was administered both before and after; (a) anodal (b) cathodal and (c) sham tDCS. Participants who received tDCS over the left PPC demonstrated pseudoneglect for the greyscales task, which was significantly reduced by anodal tDCS, but was unaffected by sham or cathodal tDCS. In contrast, for those participants who received right PPC tDCS, pseudoneglect for the greyscales task was unaffected by tDCS. Anodal tDCS, which is known to elevate neural excitation, may have overcome lower levels of activation in the left PPC, resulting in decreased pseudoneglect. These findings provide convincing evidence in support of an activation-orientation model of pseudoneglect and have implications for models of left neglect."

Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), an emerging technique of non-invasive brain stimulation, has shown to produce beneficial neural effects in consequence with improvements in motor behavior. tDCS has gained popularity as it is economical, simple to use, portable, and increases corticospinal excitability without producing any serious side effects. As tDCS has been increasingly investigated as an effective tool for various disorders, numerous improvements, and developments have been proposed with respect to this technique. tDCS has been widely used to identify the functional relevance of particular brain regions in motor skill learning and also to facilitate activity in specific cortical areas involved in motor learning, in turn improving motor function. Understanding the interaction between tDCS and motor learning can lead to important implications for developing various rehabilitation approaches. This paper provides a concise overview of tDCS as a neuromodulatory technique and its interaction with motor learning.

"Primary motor and premotor cortex in implicit sequence learning--evidence for competition between implicit and explicit human motor memory systems.","The European journal of neuroscience",2012,306-15,36,Array,Array,19163645,5,"Peripersonal space (PPS) representation depends on the activity of a fronto-parietal network including the premotor cortex (PMc) and the posterior parietal cortex (PPc). PPS representation has a direct effect on the motor system: a stimulus activating the PPS around the hand modulates the excitability of hand representation in the primary motor cortex. However, to date, direct information about the involvement of the PMc-PPc network in the motor mapping of sensory events occurring within PPS is lacking. To address this issue, we used a 'perturb-and-measure' paradigm based on the combination of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) techniques. Cathodal tDCS was applied to transiently suppress neural activity in PMc, PPc and primary visual cortex (V1; serving as an active control site); single-pulse TMS was used to induce motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) from hand muscles and so to measure the excitability of the hand motor representation. MEPs were compared when a sound was presented either near the hand or at a distance. In experimental sessions performed after sham-tDCS and after tDCS over the control area V1, we found a spatially dependent modulation of the hand motor representation: sounds presented near the hand induced an inhibitory motor response as compared to sounds presented far apart. Critically, this effect was selectively abolished after tDCS suppression of neural activity in PMc, but not when perturbing the activity of PPc. These findings suggest that PMc has a critical role in mapping sensory representations of space onto the motor system."

Primary motor cortex (M1) is known to be engaged during implicit motor learning, while dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) is critical for explicit learning. To elucidate the neural substrates underlying the interaction between implicit and explicit memory systems, adults underwent a randomized crossover experiment of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (AtDCS) applied over M1, PMd or sham stimulation during implicit motor sequence (serial reaction time task, SRTT) practice. We hypothesized that M1-AtDCS during practice will enhance online performance and offline learning of the implicit motor sequence. In contrast, we also hypothesized that PMd-AtDCS will attenuate performance and retention of the implicit motor sequence. Implicit sequence performance was assessed at baseline, at the end of acquisition (EoA), and 24 h after practice (retention test, RET). M1-AtDCS during practice significantly improved practice performance and supported offline stabilization compared with Sham tDCS. Performance change from EoA to RET revealed that PMd-AtDCS during practice attenuated offline stabilization compared with M1-AtDCS and sham stimulation. The results support the role of M1 in implementing online performance gains and offline stabilization for implicit motor sequence learning. In contrast, enhancing the activity within explicit motor memory network nodes such as the PMd during practice may be detrimental to offline stabilization of the learned implicit motor sequence. These results support the notion of competition between implicit and explicit motor memory systems and identify underlying neural substrates that are engaged in this competition."

Preliminary evidence suggests that tDCS may have an analgesic effect; however, the timing of these effects, especially when associated with consecutive sessions of stimulation in a controlled animal experiment setting, has yet to be fully explored. To evaluate the effects of tDCS in inflammatory chronic pain origin immediately and 24 h after the last treatment session, complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) was injected (100 μl) in the right footpad to induce inflammation. On the 15th day after CFA injection, rats were divided into two groups: tDCS (n = 9) and sham (n = 9). The tDCS was applied for 8 days. The hot plate and Von Frey tests were applied immediately and 24 h after the last tDCS session. Eight 20-min sessions of 500 μA anodal tDCS resulted in antinociceptive effects as assessed by the hot plate test immediately (P = 0.04) and 24 h after the last tDCS session (P = 0.006), for the active tDCS group only. There was increased withdrawal latency in the Von Frey test at 24 h after the last session (P = 0.01).

Counterbalancing these pathological excitability alterations by repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) or transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) improves mood in these patients. In healthy subjects, however, rTMS of the same areas has no major effect, and the effects of tDCS are mixed. We aimed to evaluate the effects of prefrontal tDCS on emotion and emotion-related cognitive processing in healthy humans. In a first study, we administered excitability-enhancing anodal, excitability-diminishing cathodal, and placebo tDCS to the left DLPFC, combined with antagonistic stimulation of the right frontopolar cortex, and tested acute emotional changes by an adjective checklist. Subjective emotions were not influenced by tDCS. Emotional face identification, however, which was explored in a second experiment, was subtly improved by a tDCS-driven excitability modulation of the prefrontal cortex, markedly by anodal tDCS of the left DLPFC for positive emotional content. We conclude that tDCS of the prefrontal cortex improves emotion processing in healthy subjects, but does not influence subjective emotional state."
"Behavioral and electrophysiological effects of transcranial direct current stimulation of the parietal cortex in a visuo-spatial working memory task.","Frontiers in psychiatry",2012,58,3,Array,Array,3397865,,"Impairments of working memory (WM) performance are frequent concomitant symptoms in several psychiatric and neurologic diseases. Despite the great advance in treating the reduced WM abilities in patients suffering from, e.g., Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease by means of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), the exact neurophysiological underpinning subserving these therapeutic tDCS-effects are still unknown. In the present study we investigated the impact of tDCS on performance in a visuo-spatial WM task and its underlying neural activity. In three experimental sessions, participants performed a delayed matching-to-sample WM task after sham, anodal, and cathodal tDCS over the right parietal cortex. The results showed that tDCS modulated WM performance and its underlying electrophysiological brain activity in a polarity-specific way. Parietal tDCS altered event-related potentials and oscillatory power in the alpha band at posterior electrode sites. The present study demonstrates that posterior tDCS can alter visuo-spatial WM performance by modulating the underlying neural activity. This result can be considered an important step toward a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in tDCS-induced modulations of cognitive processing. This is of particular importance for the application of electrical brain stimulation as a therapeutic treatment of neuropsychiatric deficits in clinical populations."

Aims: This study evaluated the feasibility, safety, acceptability, and clinical outcomes of a 2-week tDCS antidepressant treatment in HIV-MDD co-diagnosed patients, and the feasibility of collecting serum and saliva for analysis of immunity biomarkers. Methods: Ten enrolled patients underwent baseline evaluation and started the tDCS treatment (Monday-Friday for 2 weeks) delivered with Phoresor II 850 PM for 20 min at 2 mA at each visit, using two saline-soaked sponge electrodes placed over the F3 position of EEG 10-20 system and the contralateral supraorbital region. Outcome measures were collected at baseline, after the last tDCS and 2 weeks later. A quantitative microarray (Ray Bio Tech Inc.) for TH1/TH2 cytokines was used for saliva and plasma analysis. Results: Analyzable outcome-data were obtained from eight subjects. Depression scores significantly decreased (p < 0.0005) after the treatment. No serious adverse events occurred. Several transient minor AEs and occasional changes of blood pressure and heart rate were noted. Mini-mental state examination scores remained unchanged or increased after the treatment. All subjects were highly satisfied with the protocol and treatment results and described the desire to find new treatments for HIV-MDD as motivating participation. Conclusion: Findings support feasibility and clinical potential of tDCS for HIV-MDD patients, and justify larger-sample, sham-controlled trials."

They can also interact with processes of normal learning, to increase or decrease the rate of learning and retention. These features have spurred a number of investigators to test whether there is any clinical therapeutic potential for the methods to improve recovery of function after damage to the brain by injury or disease. The only condition where there is sufficient evidence is in certain forms of depression where excitatory rTMS is a recommended treatment protocol; there is insufficient evidence for any other condition. The problem facing investigators is the variety of possible paradigms that can be applied. Particularly for tDCS, only a small range of possible parameters has been tested, even in healthy volunteers; in addition, it is unclear whether stimulation should be applied at the same time as a behavioral therapy or whether stimulation should be applied at rest. Present trials give some evidence that can be used to address these questions, but until they are answered more securely it will be difficult to reach a consensus about ""standard"" protocols that can then be tested widely in multicenter trials."

The aim of present study was to evaluate whether a long-lasting suppression of cortical excitability could be induced by prolonged cathodal tDCS (20 min of stimulation). We also explored the impact of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene polymorphisms, on tDCS after-effects. Cortical excitability to single and paired-pulse TMS was evaluated both for the stimulated and contralateral hemisphere, before and up to 24 h after 20 min of cathodal tDCS. We evaluated threshold and amplitude of MEPs, short interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), and intracortical facilitation (ICF). tDCS produced a pronounced suppression of MEP amplitude that was still significant at 3 h after the end of stimulation. The BDNF genotype had not influence on tDCS after-effects. Thresholds for MEPs, SICI and ICF were not affected. No significant effect was observed in the contralateral hemisphere. Twenty minutes of cathodal tDCS is capable of inducing a long-lasting suppression of the excitability of the human motor cortex."
"Numerical estimation of the current density in the heart during transcranial direct current stimulation.","Brain stimulation",2013,58,6,Array,Array,13688369,3,"Data from neuropsychology and neuroimaging studies indicate hemispheric asymmetries in processing object's global form versus local parts. However the attentional mechanisms subtending visual selection of different levels of information are poorly understood. The classical left hemisphere/local-right hemisphere/global dichotomy has been recently challenged by studies linking the asymmetry of activation in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) with the relative salience of the stimulus rather than with the local/global level. The present study aimed to assess hemispheric asymmetry in local-global and salience-based selection in hierarchical stimuli by using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). To this end, tDCS has been applied to the PPC of both the hemispheres. Our data revealed that tDCS did affect the selection of the target on the basis of its relative salience in a manner that depended on the tDCS polarity applied to the two hemispheres. This result is in line with previous findings that the left PPC is critically involved in attention for low-salience stimuli in the presence of high-salience distractor information, while right PPC is involved in attending to more salient stimuli. Hemispheric asymmetries were also found in local/global selection. Overall the results suggest that neural activation in the PPC is related to both the salience and the level of stimulus representations mediating responses to hierarchical stimuli. The comparison of the results from Experiments 1 and 2 in local/global-based selection suggests that the effect of stimulation could be completely opposite depending on subtle differences in demands of attentional control (sustained attention vs task switching)."

Changes in brain activations are one presumed contributor to WM decline in the healthy aging population. In particular, neuroimaging studies show that when older adults perform WM tasks there tends to be greater bilateral frontal activity than in younger adults. We hypothesized that stimulating the prefrontal cortex in healthy older adults would improve WM performance. To test this hypothesis we employed transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a neurostimulation technique in which small amounts of electrical current are applied to the scalp with the intent of modulating the activity in underlying neurons. Across three testing sessions we applied sham stimulation or anodal tDCS to the left (F3) or right (F4) prefrontal cortex to healthy older adults as they performed trials of verbal and visual 2-back WM tasks. Surprisingly, tDCS was uniformly beneficial across site and WM task, but only in older adults with more education. In the less educated group, tDCS provided no benefit to verbal or visual WM performance. We interpret these findings as evidence for differential frontal recruitment as a function of strategy when older adults perform WM tasks."

We aimed to investigate further this hypothesis by modulating directly prefrontal cortex excitability using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) - a non-invasive, neuromodulatory tool that induces polarity-dependent changes in cortical excitability - and measuring effects on salivary cortisol and heart rate variability as proxies of the HPA and SAM systems. Twenty healthy participants with no clinical and neuropsychiatric conditions were randomized to receive bifrontal tDCS (left anodal/right cathodal or left cathodal/right anodal) or sham stimulation, in a within-subject design. During each stimulation session, after a resting period, subjects were shown images with neutral or negative valence. Our findings showed that excitability enhancing left anodal tDCS induced a decrease in cortisol levels. This effect is more pronounced during emotional negative stimuli. Moreover, vagal activity was higher during left anodal tDCS and emotional negative stimuli, as compared to sham stimulation and neutral images. We also observed an association between higher mood scores, higher vagal activation and lower cortisol levels for anodal stimulation. Subjective mood and anxiety evaluation revealed no specific changes after stimulation.

"When less is more: evidence for a facilitative cathodal tDCS effect in attentional abilities.","Journal of cognitive neuroscience",2012,58-66,24,Array,Array,22624605,9,"Many previous studies reported that the hyperpolarization of cortical neurons following cathodal stimulation (in transcranial direct current stimulation) has resulted in cognitive performance degradation. Here, we challenge this assumption by showing that cathodal stimulation will not always degrade cognitive performance. We used an attentional load paradigm in which irrelevant stimuli are processed only under low but not under high attentional load. Thirty healthy participants were randomly allocated into three interventional groups with different brain stimulation parameters (active anodal posterior parietal cortex [PPC], active cathodal PPC, and sham). Cathodal but not anodal stimulation enabled flanker processing even in high-loaded scenes. A second experiment was carried out to assert whether the improved flanker processing under cathodal stimulation is because of altered attention allocation between center and surround or, alternatively, enhanced attentional resources. In this experiment, the flanker was presented centrally. The results of Experiment 2 replicated Experiment 1's finding of improved flanker processing. We interpret the results from these two experiments as evidence for the ability of cathodal stimulation to enhance attentional resources rather than simply change attention allocation between center and periphery. Cathodal stimulation in high-loaded scenes can act like a noise filter and may in fact enhance cognitive performance. This study contributes to understanding the way the PPC is engaged with attentional functions and explains the cathodal effects, which thus might lead to more efficient brain stimulation protocols."
"Modulation of soleus H reflex by spinal DC stimulation in humans.","Journal of neurophysiology",2012,58-66,108,Array,Array,22623482,3,"Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the human motor cortex induces changes in excitability within cortical and spinal circuits that occur during and after the stimulation. Recently, transcutaneous spinal direct current stimulation (tsDCS) has been shown to modulate spinal conduction properties, as assessed by somatosensory-evoked potentials, and transynaptic properties of the spinal neurons, as tested by postactivation depression of the H reflex or by the RIII nociceptive component of the flexion reflex in the lower limb. To further explore tsDCS-induced plastic changes in spinal excitability, we examined, in a double-blind crossover randomized study, the stimulus-response curves of the soleus H reflex before, during, at current offset and 15 min after anodal, cathodal, and sham tsDCS delivered at the Th11 level (2.5 mA, 15 min, 0.071 mA/cm(2), 0.064 C/cm(2)) in 17 healthy subjects. Anodal tsDCS induced a progressive leftward shift of the recruitment curve of the soleus H reflex during the stimulation; the effects persisted for at least 15 min after current offset. In contrast, both cathodal and sham tsDCS had no significant effects. This exploratory study provides further evidence for the use of tsDCS as an expedient, noninvasive tool to induce long-lasting plastic changes in spinal circuitry. Increased spinal excitability after anodal tsDCS may have potential for spinal neuromodulation in patients with central nervous system lesions."

Thus alternative therapeutic strategies such as non-invasive brain stimulation are needed. Few studies have demonstrated that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a method of neuromodulation with consecutive robust excitability changes within the stimulated cortex area, is beneficial in AD. There is also evidence that tDCS enhances memory function in cognitive rehabilitation in depressive patients, Parkinson's disease, and stroke. tDCS improves working and visual recognition memory in humans and object-recognition learning in the elderly. AD's neurobiological mechanisms comprise changes in neuronal activity and the cerebral blood flow (CBF) caused by altered microvasculature, synaptic dysregulation from ß-amyloid peptide accumulation, altered neuromodulation via degenerated modulatory amine transmitter systems, altered brain oscillations, and changes in network connectivity. tDCS alters (i) neuronal activity and (ii) human CBF, (iii) has synaptic and non-synaptic after-effects (iv), can modify neurotransmitters polarity-dependently, (v) and alter oscillatory brain activity and (vi) functional connectivity patterns in the brain. It thus is reasonable to use tDCS as a therapeutic instrument in AD as it improves cognitive function in manner based on a disease mechanism. Moreover, it could prove valuable in other types of dementia. Future large-scale clinical and mechanism-oriented studies may enable us to identify its therapeutic validity in other types of demential disorders."

"Translational application of neuromodulation of decision-making.","Brain stimulation",2012,1963-7,5,Array,Array,10835468,2,"Humans have an unparalleled ability to represent objects as members of multiple categories. A given object, such as a pillow may be-depending on current task demands-represented as an instance of something that is soft, as something that contains feathers, as something that is found in bedrooms, or something that is larger than a toaster. This type of processing requires the individual to dynamically highlight task-relevant properties and abstract over or suppress object properties that, although salient, are not relevant to the task at hand. Neuroimaging and neuropsychological evidence suggests that this ability may depend on cognitive control processes associated with the left inferior prefrontal gyrus. Here, we show that stimulating the left inferior frontal cortex using transcranial direct current stimulation alters performance of healthy subjects on a simple categorization task. Our task required subjects to select pictures matching a description, e.g., ""click on all the round things."" Cathodal stimulation led to poorer performance on classification trials requiring attention to specific dimensions such as color or shape as opposed to trials that required selecting items belonging to a more thematic category such as objects that hold water. A polarity reversal (anodal stimulation) lowered the threshold for selecting items that were more weakly associated with the target category. These results illustrate the role of frontally-mediated control processes in categorization and suggest potential interactions between categorization, cognitive control, and language."

However, it is not yet known precisely which aspects of working memory - a broad theoretical concept including short-term memory and various executive functions - are involved in such effects. In the current study, we aimed to determine whether tDCS would reduce bias effects on an Implicit Association Test, in which subjects must respond either congruently or incongruently to pre-existing evaluative associations. Such biases reflect a conflict between automatic associations and executive function, and tDCS was hypothesized to cause a shift in this balance in favor of executive function. The results clearly contradicted this hypothesis: tDCS did improve reaction times, but in the congruent rather than incongruent mapping condition. We conclude that DLPFC tDCS does not directly improve the ability to overcome bias; previous findings concerning working memory enhancement appear to reflect effects on a different component of executive function."

Specifically the ""inhibitory"" effect performed by tDCS (transcranial Direct Current Stimulation) on DLPFC was analyzed by measuring alpha frequency band modulation when subjects processed congruous/incongruous object-related action. Thirty-four subjects performed the congruence detection task within a dynamic context (a sequence of four action frames), where the final one could be congruous or incongruous. The stimulation effect (cathode applied on the DLPFC and anode on the control site) was analyzed comparing the RTs (response times) and alpha modifications before and after the stimulation. A significant alpha increasing was found for incongruous actions in case of cathodic stimulation of DLPFC compared with the pre-stimulation condition. Moreover, RTs showed a significant reduction in response to incongruous condition after tDCS stimulation. It was suggested that the inhibition of DLPFC may limit the ""incongruence effect"" induced by the semantic anomaly. Secondly, the contribution of the frontal area for the semantic processing of action was demonstrated. Finally, tDCS influence on cortical oscillations was largely supported, showing alpha modulation induced by DLPFC inhibition."
"Effects of motor cortex modulation and descending inhibitory systems on pain thresholds in healthy subjects.","The journal of pain : official journal of the American Pain Society",2012,82-6,13,Array,Array,22515945,5,"Pain modulation can be achieved using neuromodulatory tools that influence various levels of the nervous system. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), for instance, has been shown to reduce chronic pain when applied to the primary motor cortex. In contrast to this central neuromodulatory technique, diffuse noxious inhibitory controls (DNIC) refers to endogenous analgesic mechanisms that decrease pain following the introduction of heterotopic noxious stimuli. We examined whether combining top-down motor cortex modulation using anodal tDCS with a bottom-up DNIC induction paradigm synergistically increases the threshold at which pain is perceived. The pain thresholds of 15 healthy subjects were assessed before and after administration of active tDCS, sham tDCS, cold-water-induced DNIC, and combined tDCS and DNIC. We found that both tDCS and the DNIC paradigm significantly increased pain thresholds and that these approaches appeared to have additive effects. Increase in pain threshold following active tDCS was positively correlated with baseline N-acetylaspartate in the cingulate cortex and negatively correlated with baseline glutamine levels in the thalamus as measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. These results suggest that motor cortex modulation may have a greater analgesic effect when combined with bottom-up neuromodulatory mechanisms, presenting new avenues for modulation of pain using noninvasive neuromodulatory approaches."

Ambiguous prime words were presented followed by target words that could be associated to the dominant or subordinate meaning of the prime in a semantic relatedness task. Anodal stimulation of the right Wernicke's area significantly decreased response time (RTs) to subordinate but not dominant associations compared to sham stimulation. There was also a complementary trend of faster responses to dominant associations following anodal stimulation of Wernicke's area.

"The Factors Associated with Good Responses to Speech Therapy Combined with Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation in Post-stroke Aphasic Patients.","Annals of rehabilitation medicine",2011,82-6,35,Array,Array,1955532,4,"We have previously shown that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) improved performance of a complex visual perceptual learning task (Clark et al. 2012). However, it is not known whether tDCS can enhance perceptual sensitivity independently of non-specific, arousal-linked changes in response bias, nor whether any such sensitivity benefit can be retained over time. We examined the influence of stimulation of the right inferior frontal cortex using tDCS on perceptual learning and retention in 37 healthy participants, using signal detection theory to distinguish effects on perceptual sensitivity (d') from response bias (ß). Anodal stimulation with 2 mA increased d', compared to a 0.1 mA sham stimulation control, with no effect on ß. On completion of training, participants in the active stimulation group had more than double the perceptual sensitivity of the control group. Furthermore, the performance enhancement was maintained for 24 hours. The results show that tDCS augments both skill acquisition and retention in a complex detection task and that the benefits are rooted in an improvement in sensitivity (d'), rather than changes in response bias (ß). Stimulation-driven acceleration of learning and its retention over 24 hours may result from increased activation of prefrontal cortical regions that provide top-down attentional control signals to object recognition areas."
"Task-specific facilitation of cognition by cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation of the cerebellum.","Brain stimulation",2012,84-94,5,Array,Array,22494832,2,"A role for the cerebellum in cognition is controversial, but it is a view that is becoming increasingly popular. The aim of the current study was to investigate this issue using transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) during two cognitive tasks that require comparable motor skills, but different levels of working memory and attention. Three groups of twenty-two participants each performed the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task (PASAT) and a novel variant of this task called the Paced Auditory Serial Subtraction Task (PASST), together with a verb generation task and its two controls, before and after the modulation of cortico-cerebellar connectivity using anodal or cathodal tDCS over the cerebellum. Participants' performance in the difficult PASST task significantly improved after cathodal stimulation compared to sham or anodal stimulation. Improvement in the easier PASAT was equal across all three stimulation conditions. Improvement in verbal response latencies were also greatest during the PASST task after cathodal stimulation, compared to sham and anodal stimulation, and became less variable. Results for the verb generation task complimented those for the PASST, such that the rate and consistency of participants' verbal responses were facilitated by cathodal stimulation, compared to sham and anodal stimulation. These findings suggest that DC stimulation over the right cerebellum affects working memory and attention differently depending on task difficulty. They support a role for the cerebellum in cognitive aspects of behaviour, whereby activity in the prefrontal cortex is likely dis-inhibited by cathodal tDCS stimulation over the right cerebellar cortex, which normally exerts an overall inhibitory tone on the cerebral cortex. We speculate that the cerebellum is capable of releasing cognitive resources by dis-inhibition of prefrontal regions of cerebral cortex, enhancing performance when tasks become demanding."
"Brain stimulation and inhibitory control.","Brain stimulation",2012,84-94,5,Array,Array,21227233,2,"Inhibitory control mechanisms are important in a range of behaviours to prevent execution of motor acts which, having been planned, are no longer necessary or appropriate. Examples of this can be seen in a range of sports, such as cricket and baseball, where the choice between execution and inhibition of a bat swing must be made in a very brief time window. Deficits in inhibitory control have been associated with problems in behavioural regulation in impulsive violence as well as a range of clinical disorders. The roles of various areas, including the frontal eye fields (FEF), the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA) and the inferior frontal gyrus, in inhibitory control have been investigated using an inhibitory control task and both transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Typically effects on response inhibition but no effects on response generation have been seen. The contributions of these areas to performance seem to differ with, for example, pre-SMA being involved when the task is relatively novel whereas this is not the case for FEF. The findings from brain stimulation studies offer both insight into which areas are necessary for effective inhibitory control and recent extension of findings for the role of the inferior frontal gyrus illustrate how the specific functions by which these areas contribute may be further clarified. Future work, including making use of the temporal specificity of TMS and combination of TMS/tDCS with other neuroimaging techniques, may further clarify the nature and functions played by the network of areas involved in inhibitory control."

"Enhancing cognitive control components of insight problems solving by anodal tDCS of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.","Brain stimulation",2012,84-94,5,Array,Array,10928739,2,"Transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) is a noninvasive brain stimulation technique that has been successfully applied for modulation of cortical excitability. tDCS is capable of inducing changes in neuronal membrane potentials in a polarity-dependent manner. When tDCS is of sufficient length, synaptically driven after-effects are induced. The mechanisms underlying these after-effects are largely unknown, and there is a compelling need for animal models to test the immediate effects and after-effects induced by tDCS in different cortical areas and evaluate the implications in complex cerebral processes. Here we show in behaving rabbits that tDCS applied over the somatosensory cortex modulates cortical processes consequent to localized stimulation of the whisker pad or of the corresponding area of the ventroposterior medial (VPM) thalamic nucleus. With longer stimulation periods, poststimulation effects were observed in the somatosensory cortex only after cathodal tDCS. Consistent with the polarity-specific effects, the acquisition of classical eyeblink conditioning was potentiated or depressed by the simultaneous application of anodal or cathodal tDCS, respectively, when stimulation of the whisker pad was used as conditioned stimulus, suggesting that tDCS modulates the sensory perception process necessary for associative learning. We also studied the putative mechanisms underlying immediate effects and after-effects of tDCS observed in the somatosensory cortex. Results when pairs of pulses applied to the thalamic VPM nucleus (mediating sensory input) during anodal and cathodal tDCS suggest that tDCS modifies thalamocortical synapses at presynaptic sites. Finally, we show that blocking the activation of adenosine A1 receptors prevents the long-term depression (LTD) evoked in the somatosensory cortex after cathodal tDCS."
"Are glial cells responsible for transcranial direct current stimulation?","Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology",2012,84-94,123,Array,Array,11119699,10,"Chronic neuropathic pain is one of the most prevalent and debilitating disorders. Conventional medical management, however, remains frustrating for both patients and clinicians owing to poor specificity of pharmacotherapy, delayed onset of analgesia and extensive side effects. Neuromodulation presents as a promising alternative, or at least an adjunct, as it is more specific in inducing analgesia without associated risks of pharmacotherapy. Here, we discuss common clinical and investigational methods of neuromodulation. Compared to clinical spinal cord stimulation (SCS), investigational techniques of cerebral neuromodulation, both invasive (deep brain stimulation [DBS] and motor cortical stimulation [MCS]) and noninvasive (repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation [rTMS] and transcranial direct current stimulation [tDCS]), may be more advantageous. By adaptively targeting the multidimensional experience of pain, subtended by integrative pain circuitry in the brain, including somatosensory and thalamocortical, limbic and cognitive, cerebral methods may modulate the sensory-discriminative, affective-emotional and evaluative-cognitive spheres of the pain neuromatrix. Despite promise, the current state of results alludes to the possibility that cerebral neuromodulation has thus far not been effective in producing analgesia as intended in patients with chronic pain disorders. These techniques, thus, remain investigational and off-label. We discuss issues implicated in inadequate efficacy, variability of responsiveness, and poor retention of benefit, while recommending design and conceptual refinements for future trials of cerebral neuromodulation in management of chronic neuropathic pain."

These results suggest that extracephalic reference electrodes do not lead to unwanted modulation of the brainstem cardio-respiratory and autonomic centers, as indicated by recent experimental studies. The volume energy density was concentrated at the neck area by the use of deltoid reference electrodes, but was still smaller than that around the active electrode locations. In addition, the distributions of elicited cortical electric fields demonstrated that the use of extracephalic reference electrodes might allow for the robust prediction of cortical modulations with little dependence on the reference electrode locations."
"Impact of tDCS on performance and learning of target detection: interaction with stimulus characteristics and experimental design.",Neuropsychologia,2012,1628-31,50,Array,Array,22450198,7,"We have previously found that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over right inferior frontal cortex (RIFC) enhances performance during learning of a difficult visual target detection task (Clark et al., 2012). In order to examine the cognitive mechanisms of tDCS that lead to enhanced performance, here we analyzed its differential effects on responses to stimuli that varied by repetition and target presence, differences related to expectancy by comparing performance in single- and double-blind task designs, and individual differences in skin stimulation and mood. Participants were trained for 1h to detect target objects hidden in a complex virtual environment, while anodal tDCS was applied over RIFC at 0.1 mA or 2.0 mA for the first 30 min. Participants were tested immediately before and after training and again 1h later. Higher tDCS current was associated with increased performance for all test stimuli, but was greatest for repeated test stimuli with the presence of hidden-targets. This finding was replicated in a second set of subjects using a double-blind task design. Accuracy for target detection discrimination sensitivity (d'; Z(hits)-Z(false alarms)) was greater for 2.0 mA current (1.77) compared with 0.1 mA (0.95), with no differences in response bias (β). Taken together, these findings indicate that the enhancement of performance with tDCS is sensitive to stimulus repetition and target presence, but not to changes in expectancy, mood, or type of blinded task design. The implications of these findings for understanding the cognitive mechanisms of tDCS are discussed."

However, there has been no trial to determine whether it has a therapeutic benefit in the early stage of cerebral ischemia, and there is no consensus on the optimal time window of stimulation. Here, we described the effects of anodal tDCS in early cerebral ischemia, assessing functional improvements and changes in neuronal plasticity, and identifying the optimal time window for delivering tDCS to maximize functional gains. Thirty rats were randomly assigned to three groups: sham (n=10); early tDCS (ET), receiving tDCS 1day after ischemia for 5 days (n=10), and late tDCS (LT), receiving tDCS 1 week after ischemia for 5 days (n=10). Both ET and LT groups showed improved Barnes maze performance and motor behavioral index scores. However, only the LT group exhibited improvement in beam balance test. Immunohistochemical stainings showed that the ET group reinforced notable MAP-2 expression and the LT group enhanced mainly the level of GAP-43 in both peri-lesional and contralesional cortex. These immunohistochemical results had significant correlation with behavioral and cognitive functions. However, brain MRI and (1)H MRS showed no significant differences among the three groups in ischemic volume and metabolic alteration. These results suggest that anodal tDCS has the potential to modulate neural plasticity around the ischemic penumbra and even in the contralesional area without aggravating infarction volume and metabolic alteration. The degree of functional improvement was slightly greater when tDCS was applied 1 week rather than 1 day after ischemic injury."
"Exploration and modulation of brain network interactions with noninvasive brain stimulation in combination with neuroimaging.","The European journal of neuroscience",2012,1628-31,35,Array,Array,22440856,6,"Nicotine improves cognitive functions by modulating neuroplasticity and cortical excitability in nonsmoking subjects. As shown recently, the positive effect of nicotine on cognition might at least partially be caused by a focusing effect of nicotine on neuroplasticity in these subjects. Concordant to this, smokers under nicotine withdrawal show reduced cognitive abilities, which are at least partially restituted by nicotine consumption. We aimed to explore the neurophysiological foundation of these effects by exploring nonfocal and focal plasticity-inducing protocols in human smokers under nicotine withdrawal and exposition. Focal, synapse-specific plasticity was induced by paired associative stimulation (PAS), while nonfocal plasticity was induced by transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Each subject (12) received placebo and nicotine patches combined with one of the stimulation protocols to the primary motor cortex. Corticospinal excitability was monitored by transcranial magnetic stimulation-induced motor-evoked potential amplitudes. In smokers during nicotine withdrawal, facilitatory plasticity induced by tDCS and PAS was abolished, but restituted by nicotine. In contrast, excitability-diminishing plasticity was not affected by nicotine withdrawal. Under nicotine, the inhibitory aftereffects of PAS were delayed and prolonged, while the tDCS-generated excitability reduction was abolished. Thus, absent facilitatory plasticity in smokers during nicotine withdrawal is restituted by nicotine, favoring the deficit-compensating hypothesis of nicotine consumption. These results might shed further light on the proposed mechanism of nicotine on cognition and attention, which might be connected to nicotine addiction and probability of relapse in smokers."

Yet paradoxically they can be effortless for those with an unusual mind. We discovered that an atypical protocol for non-invasive brain stimulation enabled the solution of a problem that was previously unsolvable. The majority of studies over the last century find that no participants can solve the nine-dot problem - a fact we confirmed. But with 10 min of right lateralising transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), more than 40% of participants did so. Specifically, whereas no participant solved this extremely difficult problem before stimulation or with sham stimulation, 14 out of 33 participants did so with cathodal stimulation of the left anterior temporal lobe together with anodal stimulation of the right anterior temporal lobe. This finding suggests that our stimulation paradigm might be helpful for mitigating cognitive biases or dealing with a broader class of tasks that, although deceptively simple, are nonetheless extremely difficult due to our cognitive makeup."

Surprisingly, no studies have yet investigated pseudoneglect in first-degree relatives (FdR) of psychiatric patients. We investigated performance on ""paper and pencil"" line bisection (LB) tasks in 68 schizophrenic patients (SCZ), 42 unaffected FdR, 41 unipolar depressive patients (UP), and 103 healthy subjects (HS). A subgroup of 20 SCZ and 16 HS underwent computerized LB and mental number line bisection (MNL) tasks requiring judgment of prebisected lines and numerical intervals. Moreover, we evaluated, in a subgroup of 15 SCZ, performance on LB and MNL before and after parietal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). In comparison to HS and UP, SCZ showed a systematic rightward bias on LB, partially corrected by selective right posterior parietal tDCS. Interestingly, even FdR showed a lack of pseudoneglect on LB, expressing a mean error lying in the middle between those of HS and SCZ. On the other hand, our results showed no significant difference between the performance of SCZ and HS on MNL. Both groups showed a comparable leftward bias that could not be significantly altered after left or right parietal tDCS. These findings confirm the existence of reduced lateralization in SCZ, suggesting specific impaired functioning of the right parietal lobule. Notably, we report a lack of pseudoneglect not only in SCZ but also in FdR, raising the hypothesis that an inverted laterality pattern may be considered a concrete marker of schizotypal traits."

We conducted a double-blinded, randomized, sham-controlled, cross-over trial. Eleven right-handed, healthy individuals (five women, mean age: 39.8 years, SD 13.4) received the three interventions (cross-over design) in a randomized order: (a) high-frequency (HF) rTMS (+sham tDCS), (b) anodal tDCS (+sham rTMS), and (c) sham stimulation (sham rTMS+sham tDCS). Cortical excitability measurements [motor threshold, motor evoked potential (MEP), intracortical facilitation and inhibition, and transcallosal inhibition] and motor behavioral assessments were used as outcome measures. Between-group analysis of variance showed that MEP amplitude after HF rTMS was significantly higher than MEP amplitude after anodal tDCS (P=0.001). Post-hoc analysis showed a significant increase in MEP amplitude after HF rTMS (25.3%, P=0.036) and a significant decrease in MEP amplitude after anodal tDCS (-32.7%, P=0.001). There was a similar increase in motor function as indexed by Jebsen-Taylor Hand Function Test in the two active groups compared with sham stimulation. In conclusion, here, we showed that although both techniques induced similar motor gains, they induce opposing results in cortical excitability. HF rTMS is associated with an increase in corticospinal excitability, whereas 20 min of tDCS induces the opposite effect. We discuss potential implications of these results to future clinical experiments using rTMS or tDCS for motor function enhancement."
"Changing social norm compliance with noninvasive brain stimulation.","Science (New York, N.Y.)",2013,e2,342,Array,Array,24091703,6157,"Objective. High-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) and high-density electroencephalography require accurate models of current flow for precise targeting and current source reconstruction. At a minimum, such modeling must capture the idiosyncratic anatomy of the brain, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and skull for each individual subject. Currently, the process to build such high-resolution individualized models from structural magnetic resonance images requires labor-intensive manual segmentation, even when utilizing available automated segmentation tools. Also, accurate placement of many high-density electrodes on an individual scalp is a tedious procedure. The goal was to develop fully automated techniques to reduce the manual effort in such a modeling process. Approach. A fully automated segmentation technique based on Statical Parametric Mapping 8, including an improved tissue probability map and an automated correction routine for segmentation errors, was developed, along with an automated electrode placement tool for high-density arrays. The performance of these automated routines was evaluated against results from manual segmentation on four healthy subjects and seven stroke patients. The criteria include segmentation accuracy, the difference of current flow distributions in resulting HD-tDCS models and the optimized current flow intensities on cortical targets.Main results. The segmentation tool can segment out not just the brain but also provide accurate results for CSF, skull and other soft tissues with a field of view extending to the neck. Compared to manual results, automated segmentation deviates by only 7% and 18% for normal and stroke subjects, respectively. The predicted electric fields in the brain deviate by 12% and 29% respectively, which is well within the variability observed for various modeling choices. Finally, optimized current flow intensities on cortical targets do not differ significantly.Significance. Fully automated individualized modeling may now be feasible for large-sample EEG research studies and tDCS clinical trials."

Conference",2011,201-7,2011,Array,Array,19608907,,"The primary motor cortex (M1) is the main effector structure implicated in the generation of voluntary movements and is directly involved in motor learning. The intrinsic horizontal neuronal connections of M1 exhibit short-term and long-term plasticity, which is a strong substrate for learning-related map reorganization. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) applied for few minutes over M1 has been shown to induce relatively long-lasting plastic alterations and to modulate motor performance. Here we test the hypothesis that the relatively long-lasting synaptic modification induced by tDCS over M1 results in the alteration of associations among populations of M1 neurons which may be reflected in changes of its functional architecture. fMRI resting-state datasets were acquired immediately before and after 10 minutes of tDCS during rest, with the anode/cathode placed over the left M1. For each functional dataset, grey-matter voxels belonging to Brodmann area 4 (BA4) were labelled and afterwards BA4 voxel-based synchronization matrices were calculated and thresholded to construct undirected graphs. Nodal network parameters which characterize the architecture of functional networks (connectivity degree, clustering coefficient and characteristic path-length) were computed, transformed to volume maps and compared before and after stimulation. At the dorsolateral-BA4 region cathodal tDCS boosted local connectedness, while anodal-tDCS enhanced long distance functional communication within M1. Additionally, the more efficient the functional architecture of M1 was at baseline, the more efficient the tDCS-induced functional modulations were. In summary, we show here that it is possible to non-invasively reorganize the intrinsic functional architecture of M1, and to image such alterations."

Conference",2011,7226-9,2011,Array,Array,22256006,,"Cortical stimulation (CS) has gained wide attention for its use in augmenting neurological recovery in various conditions. Noninvasive cortical stimulations using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) are less invasive when delivering the electrical current to the patient's brain, but have several limitations. Direct cortical stimulation (DCS) using an implantable stimulation system consisting of epidurally or subdurally placed electrodes and pulse generators, provides cortical stimulation and concurrent rehabilitative training in a stable fashion without limiting a patient's activities. The effectiveness of these two types of DCS--epidural cortical stimulation (ECS) and subdural cortical stimulation (SCS)--has not been compared. In this work, a computer simulation study was conducted to predict the current density distributions (CDD) through cortical stimulations using subdurally or epidurally placed electrodes. The simulation study is based on the human motor cortex model with a three-dimensional finite element model (FEM). The change in CDD depending on the shape of the electrode (disc or ring) is discussed. The output current induced by SCS was about four times larger than that of ECS when voltage stimulations with the same magnitude were regulated. Thus, SCS showed substantially better penetration of the current into gray or white matter. Further, the ring electrode performed comparably or slightly inferior to the disc electrode in both cortical stimulations."

We employed transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS, current intensity: 80 μA, and 40 μA; anodal electrode area: 3.14 mm(2); stimulation time: 30 minutes) over the M1 area to relieve the ipsilateral bias in the rat model. A corridor test was set to count the ipsilateral bias of the rats. In this experiment, 30 Sprague-Dawley rats (80 μA: n = 8, 40 μA: n = 8, sham: n = 7, healthy control: n = 7) were chosen for the corridor test and the tDCS session. The lesioned rats exhibited increased ipsilateral bias 4 weeks after the lesion surgery (P < 0.01), and the anodal tDCS with the active electrode on the lesioned side relieved the ipsilateral bias significantly (P < 0.01) immediately after the surgery and the improvement lasted for nearly 1 day. The rats in the group of 80 μA exhibited more significant changes than the 40 μA group after one day. After all the experiments, the histological process showed no neurotrauma led by the tDCS. In conclusion, the modulatory function of the cortical excitability of the tDCS may awaken the compensatory mechanisms and the response mechanisms which modulate the loss of the brain function. Further studies should be done to provide more evidence about the assumption."

Recent studies suggest that the after-effects of tDCS are related to molecular mechanisms of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. Here we investigated the effect of DCS on the induction of one of the most studied N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor-dependent forms of long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic activity at CA3-CA1 synapses in the hippocampus. We show that DCS applied to rat brain slices determines a modulation of LTP that is increased by anodal and reduced by cathodal DCS. Immediate early genes, such as c-fos and zif268 (egr1/NGFI-A/krox24), are rapidly induced following neuronal activation, and a specific role of zif268 in the induction and maintenance of LTP has been demonstrated. We found that both anodal and cathodal DCS produce a marked subregion-specific increase in the expression of zif268 protein in the cornus ammonis (CA) region, whereas the same protocols of stimulation produce a less pronounced increase in c-fos protein expression in the CA and in dentate gyrus regions of the hippocampus. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression was also investigated, and it was found to be reduced in cathodal-stimulated slices. The present data demonstrate that it is possible to modulate LTP by using DCS and provide the rationale for the use of DCS in neurological diseases to promote the adaptive and suppress the maladaptive forms of brain plasticity."
"Transcranial direct current stimulation for depression: 3-week, randomised, sham-controlled trial.","The British journal of psychiatry : the journal of mental science",2012,7226-9,200,Array,Array,22219028,1,"Transcranial magnetic stimulation and neuroimaging data have revealed bilateral posterior parietal cortex (PPC) involvement during verbal n-back working memory (WM). In this task as n (i.e., WM load) increases, subjects show poorer behavioral performance as well as greater activation of this brain area. Moreover, there is evidence that a brief period of practice or even increased familiarity with the task can improve WM performance and lead to activation changes in the PPC. The aim of this study was to investigate, using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), the effects on WM load performance induced by different PPC modulation after increased familiarity with the task. After a short practice, we tested verbal WM using an n-back task (1-back vs. 2-back) before and after the application of bilateral tDCS over PPCs (left anodal-right cathodal, left cathodal-right anodal or sham). ANOVA showed a significant interaction between tDCS and task. In the 1-back task, left anodal-right cathodal modulation abolished improvement in reaction times observed in the other two modulation conditions. Conversely, in the 2-back task the same effect was observed after left cathodal-right anodal modulation relative to the other two modulation conditions. This double dissociation demonstrates either a differential engagement of each PPC or changes in the interhemispheric balance of activity across this brain region. Neuroimaging studies show parametric activation of the PPC as difficulty increases, but activation does not switch sides. Thus, our observed effects cannot be attributed to increased task difficulty, the stimuli used, or the response requirements. Rather, we suggest that these findings reflect the use of different processing strategies to perform these two tasks. In conclusion, after increased familiarity with the task, different tDCS modulations lead to changes in a task-related region depending on differences in processing strategies in 1-back vs. 2-back."
"Transcranial stimulation in depression.","The British journal of psychiatry : the journal of mental science",2012,7226-9,200,Array,Array,14244793,1,"REM sleep is a unique brain state characterized by frontal deactivation alongside activation of the posterior association and limbic cortices. Human brain lesion studies have found that the loss of dreaming is characterized by damage to the frontal and posterior parieto-temporo-occipital association cortex. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the function of these brain regions might encapsulate the neural processes of dreaming. The aim of the following two experiments was to investigate the effect of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCs), applied simultaneously to the frontal and right posterior parietal cortex during Stage 2 sleep, on dreaming. In Experiment 1, 17 healthy participants received tDCs (cathodal-frontal, anodal-parietal) and low-intensity tDCs as well as no tDCs (blank control) during Stage 2 sleep in a counterbalanced order across the night. Dream reports were collected upon awakening after each of the three conditions. In Experiment 2, 10 participants received tDCs (cathodal-frontal, anodal-parietal), no tDCs (blank control) and two additional control conditions (reversed polarity and other-cephalic tDCs). In both experiments a significantly greater number of imagery reports were found on awakening after tDCs (cathodal-frontal, anodal-parietal), compared to the blank control conditions. However, in Experiment 2 the frequency of imagery reports from the tDCs (cathodal-frontal, anodal-parietal) was not significantly different from the other two tDC conditions, suggesting a non-specific effect of tDCs. Overall, it was concluded that tDCs (cathodal-frontal, anodal-parietal) increased the frequency of dream reports with visual imagery, possibly via a general arousing effect and/or recreating specific cortical neural activity involved in dreaming."
"Transcranial direct current stimulation preconditioning modulates the effect of high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in the human motor cortex.","The European journal of neuroscience",2012,119-24,35,Array,Array,22211744,1,"Experimental studies emphasize the importance of homeostatic plasticity as a mean of stabilizing the properties of neural circuits. In the present work we combined two techniques able to produce short-term (5-Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, rTMS) and long-term (transcranial direct current stimulation, tDCS) effects on corticospinal excitability to evaluate whether and how the effects of 5-Hz rTMS can be tuned by tDCS preconditioning. Twelve healthy subjects participated in the study. Brief trains of 5-Hz rTMS were applied to the primary motor cortex at an intensity of 120% of the resting motor threshold, with recording of the electromyograph traces evoked by each stimulus of the train from the contralateral abductor pollicis brevis muscle. This interventional protocol was preconditioned by 15 min of anodal or cathodal tDCS delivered at 1.5 mA intensity. Our results showed that motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) increased significantly in size during trains of 5-Hz rTMS in the absence of tDCS preconditioning. After facilitatory preconditioning with anodal tDCS, 5-Hz rTMS failed to produce progressive MEP facilitation. Conversely, when 5-Hz rTMS was preceded by inhibitory cathodal tDCS, MEP facilitation was not abolished. These findings may give insight into the mechanisms of homeostatic plasticity in the human cerebral cortex, suggesting also more suitable applications of tDCS in a clinical setting."
"Modulation of untruthful responses with non-invasive brain stimulation.","Frontiers in psychiatry",2012,119-24,3,Array,Array,23550273,,"Deceptive abilities have long been studied in relation to personality traits. More recently, studies explored the neural substrates associated with deceptive skills suggesting a critical role of the prefrontal cortex. Here we investigated whether non-invasive brain stimulation over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) could modulate generation of untruthful responses about subject's personal life across contexts (i.e., deceiving on guilt-free questions on daily activities; generating previously memorized lies about past experience; and producing spontaneous lies about past experience), as well as across modality responses (verbal and motor responses). Results reveal that real, but not sham, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the DLPFC can reduce response latency for untruthful over truthful answers across contexts and modality responses. Also, contexts of lies seem to incur a different hemispheric laterality. These findings add up to previous studies demonstrating that it is possible to modulate some processes involved in generation of untruthful answers by applying non-invasive brain stimulation over the DLPFC and extend these findings by showing a differential hemispheric contribution of DLPFCs according to contexts."
"Improving emotional prosody detection in the attending ear by cathodal tDCS suppression of the competing channel.","Neuroscience letters",2012,119-24,508,Array,Array,22206843,1,"Currently it is assumed that cathodal stimulation (in transcranial direct current stimulation, tDCS) degrades the neural firing rate, and thus it is believed to degrade cognitive performance. Here we challenge this assumption by predicting that under high competition the cathodal stimulation might act as a noise filter, leading to an improved performance. We presented auditory targets with different emotional valence using a dichotic listening paradigm. We found that cathodal, but not anodal stimulation of the right IFG generated better prosody comprehension. Cathodal stimulation in competitive situations, such as the dichotic listening paradigm, can act like a noise filter, and may in fact enhance cognitive performance. This study contributes to understanding the way the IFG is engaged with prosody functions, and explains the cathodal effects of tDCS. This might lead to the development of more efficient brain stimulation protocols."

As a BMI signal source, event-related desynchronization of alpha-band EEG (8-13 Hz) during motor imagery (mu ERD), which is interpreted as desynchronized activities of the activated neurons, is commonly used. However, it is often difficult for patients with severe hemiparesis to produce mu ERD of sufficient strength to activate BMI. Therefore, whether it is possible to modulate mu ERD during motor imagery with anodal transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) was assessed in a severe left hemiparetic stroke patient. EEG was recorded over the primary motor cortex (M1), and mu ERD during finger flexion imagery was measured before and after a 5-day course of tDCS applied to M1. The ERD recorded over the affected M1 increased significantly after tDCS intervention. Anodal tDCS may increase motor cortex excitability and potentiate ERD during motor imagery in patients with severe hemiparetic stroke."

However, little is known about the neurophysiological effects of tDCS on proximal upper limb function. We hypothesized that suppression of contralesional M1 (cM1) excitability would produce neurophysiological effects that depended on the severity of upper limb impairment. Twelve patients with varying upper limb impairment after subcortical stroke were assessed on clinical scales of upper limb spasticity, impairment, and function. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to determine lesion size and fractional anisotropy (FA) within the posterior limbs of the internal capsules indicative of corticospinal tract integrity. Excitability within paretic M1 biceps brachii representation was determined from motor-evoked potentials during selective isometric tasks, after cM1 sham stimulation and after c-tDCS. These neurophysiological data indicate that c-tDCS improved selective proximal upper limb control for mildly impaired patients and worsened it for moderate to severely impaired patients. The direction of the neurophysiological after effects of c-tDCS was strongly related to upper limb spasticity, impairment, function, and FA asymmetry between the posterior limbs of the internal capsules. These results indicate systematic variation of cM1 for proximal upper limb control after stroke and that suppression of cM1 excitability is not a ""one size fits all"" approach."

The course of recovery from aphasia after stroke is variable, and relies on the emergence of neuroplastic changes in language networks. Recent evidence suggests that rehabilitation interventions may facilitate these changes. Functional reorganization of language networks following left-hemisphere stroke and aphasia has been proposed to involve multiple mechanisms, including intrahemispheric recruitment of perilesional left-hemisphere regions and transcallosal interhemispheric interactions between lesioned left-hemisphere language areas and homologous regions in the right hemisphere. Moreover, it is debated whether interhemispheric interactions are beneficial or deleterious to recovering language networks. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) are two safe and noninvasive procedures that can be applied clinically to modulate cortical excitability during poststroke language recovery. Intervention with these noninvasive brain stimulation techniques also allows for inferences to be made regarding mechanisms of recovery, including the role of intrahemispheric and interhemispheric interactions. Here we review recent evidence that suggests that TMS and tDCS are promising tools for facilitating language recovery in aphasic patients, and examine evidence that indicates that both right and left hemisphere mechanisms of plasticity are instrumental in aphasia recovery."

This review article focuses on these stimulation methods and summarizes the latest results with regard to the application of these method over the visual areas in healthy subjects and clinical populations."

"A pilot study of the tolerability and effects of high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) on pain perception.","The journal of pain : official journal of the American Pain Society",2012,112-20,13,Array,Array,22104190,2,"Several brain stimulation technologies are beginning to evidence promise as pain treatments. However, traditional versions of 1 specific technique, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), stimulate broad regions of cortex with poor spatial precision. A new tDCS design, called high definition tDCS (HD-tDCS), allows for focal delivery of the charge to discrete regions of the cortex. We sought to preliminarily test the safety and tolerability of the HD-tDCS technique as well as to evaluate whether HD-tDCS over the motor cortex would decrease pain and sensory experience. Twenty-four healthy adult volunteers underwent quantitative sensory testing before and after 20 minutes of real (n = 13) or sham (n = 11) 2 mA HD-tDCS over the motor cortex. No adverse events occurred and no side effects were reported. Real HD-tDCS was associated with significantly decreased heat and cold sensory thresholds, decreased thermal wind-up pain, and a marginal analgesic effect for cold pain thresholds. No significant effects were observed for mechanical pain thresholds or heat pain thresholds. HD-tDCS appears well tolerated, and produced changes in underlying cortex that are associated with changes in pain perception. Future studies are warranted to investigate HD-tDCS in other applications, and to examine further its potential to affect pain perception."

"A finite element analysis of the effect of electrode area and inter-electrode distance on the spatial distribution of the current density in tDCS.","Journal of neural engineering",2011,112-20,8,Array,Array,19494149,6,"Synesthesia is an unusual condition characterized by the over-binding of two or more features and the concomitant automatic and conscious experience of atypical, ancillary images or perceptions. Previous research suggests that synesthetes display enhanced modality-specific perceptual processing, but it remains unclear whether enhanced processing contributes to conscious awareness of color photisms. In three experiments, we investigated whether grapheme-color synesthesia is characterized by enhanced cortical excitability in primary visual cortex and the role played by this hyperexcitability in the expression of synesthesia. Using transcranial magnetic stimulation, we show that synesthetes display 3-fold lower phosphene thresholds than controls during stimulation of the primary visual cortex. We next used transcranial direct current stimulation to discriminate between two competing hypotheses of the role of hyperexcitability in the expression of synesthesia. We demonstrate that synesthesia can be selectively augmented with cathodal stimulation and attenuated with anodal stimulation of primary visual cortex. A control task revealed that the effect of the brain stimulation was specific to the experience of synesthesia. These results indicate that hyperexcitability acts as a source of noise in visual cortex that influences the availability of the neuronal signals underlying conscious awareness of synesthetic photisms."
"Transcranial direct current stimulation--update 2011.","Restorative neurology and neuroscience",2011,112-20,29,Array,Array,19419432,6,"We investigated the effect of electrode area and inter-electrode distance on the spatial distribution of the current density in transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). For this purpose, we used the finite element method to compute the distribution of the current density in a four-layered spherical head model using various electrode montages, corresponding to a range of electrode sizes and inter-electrode distances. We found that smaller electrodes required slightly less current to achieve a constant value of the current density at a reference point on the brain surface located directly under the electrode center. Under these conditions, smaller electrodes also produced a more focal current density distribution in the brain, i.e. the magnitude of the current density fell more rapidly with distance from the reference point. The combination of two electrodes with different areas produced an asymmetric current distribution that could lead to more effective and localized neural modulation under the smaller electrode than under the larger one. Focality improved rapidly with decreasing electrode size when the larger electrode sizes were considered but the improvement was less marked for the smaller electrode sizes. Also, focality was not affected significantly by inter-electrode distance unless two large electrodes were placed close together. Increasing the inter-electrode distance resulted in decreased shunting of the current through the scalp and the cerebrospinal fluid, and decreasing electrode area resulted in increased current density on the scalp under the edges of the electrode. Our calculations suggest that when working with conventional electrodes (25-35 cm(2)), one of the electrodes should be placed just 'behind' the target relative to the other electrode, for maximum current density on the target. Also electrodes with areas in the range 3.5-12 cm(2) may provide a better compromise between focality and current density in the scalp than the traditional electrodes. Finally, the use of multiple small return electrodes may be more efficient than the use of a single large return electrode."

"Cerebellum and processing of negative facial emotions: cerebellar transcranial DC stimulation specifically enhances the emotional recognition of facial anger and sadness.","Cognition & emotion",2012,112-20,26,Array,Array,20633386,5,"Migraine patients are characterized by altered cortical excitability and information processing between attacks. The relationship between these abnormalities is still poorly understood. In this study, visual evoked potentials (VEP) and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy were recorded simultaneously in migraineurs and healthy subjects. In order to investigate the homeostatic-like plasticity in the visual cortex, cortical excitability was modified using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Before any stimulation, migraineurs showed significantly higher glutamate/creatine ratios (Glx/Cr) than healthy subjects. In healthy subjects, excitatory (anodal) tDCS caused an increase and inhibitory (cathodal) tDCS a decrease in the Glx/Cr ratio. Subsequent photic stimulation (PS) reversed the changes in Glx/Cr ratios, which returned back to baseline, demonstrating homeostatic-like metaplasticity in the control group. In migraine patients, both anodal and cathodal tDCS decreased the Glx/Cr ratio, which did not return to baseline after PS. While healthy subjects showed an increase in VEP amplitude under anodal and a reduction under cathodal tDCS, the modifiability of VEP under tDCS was reduced in migraineurs. The results demonstrate a reduced responsiveness of the occipital cortex to interventions that change cortical excitability in migraine. Moreover, altered glutamatergic neurotransmission seems to mediate the relation between abnormal cortical information processing and excitability in migraineurs."

A facial emotion recognition task was administered to 21 healthy subjects before and after cerebellar tDCS; we also tested subjects with a visual attention task and a visual analogue scale (VAS) for mood. Anodal and cathodal cerebellar tDCS both significantly enhanced sensory processing in response to negative facial expressions (anodal tDCS, p=.0021; cathodal tDCS, p=.018), but left positive emotion and neutral facial expressions unchanged (p>.05). tDCS over the right prefrontal cortex left facial expressions of both negative and positive emotion unchanged.

The first part of this article reviews brain stimulation studies related to language recovery in aphasic patients. The second part reports results from a pilot study with three chronic stroke patients who had non-fluent aphasia, where real or placebo rTMS was immediately followed by 25 minutes of individualised speech therapy. Real rTMS consisted of high-frequency rTMS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BA 8/9) for 25 minutes. Each patient underwent a total of four weeks of intervention. P1 underwent four weeks of real rTMS (5 days/week) where individualised speech therapy was provided for 25 minutes immediately following each rTMS session. P2 and P3 each underwent two weeks of placebo rTMS, followed immediately by individualised speech therapy; then two weeks of real rTMS, followed immediately by individualised speech therapy. Assessments took place at 2, 4, 12, 24 and 48 weeks post-entry/baseline testing. Relative to entry/baseline testing, a significant improvement in object naming was observed at all testing times, from two weeks post-intervention in real rTMS plus speech therapy, or placebo rTMS plus speech therapy.

"Non-invasive brain stimulation enhances the effects of melodic intonation therapy.","Frontiers in psychology",2011,1027-34,2,Array,Array,9629956,,"At the onset of dynamic movements excitation of the motor cortex (M1) is spatially restricted to areas representing the involved muscles whereas adjacent areas are inhibited. The current study elucidates whether the cortical motor command for dynamic contractions is also restricted to a certain population of cortical neurons responsible for the fast corticospinal projections. Therefore, corticospinal transmission was assessed with high temporal resolution during dynamic contractions after both, magnetic stimulation over M1 and the brainstem. The high temporal resolution could be obtained by conditioning the soleus H-reflex with different interstimulus intervals by cervicomedullary stimulation (CMS-conditioning) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of M1 (M1-conditioning). This technique provides a precise time course of facilitation and inhibition. CMS- and M1-conditioning produced an 'early facilitation' of the H-reflex, which occurred around 3 ms earlier with CMS-conditioning. The early facilitation is believed to be caused by activation of direct monosynaptic projections to the spinal motoneurons. CMS-conditioning resulted in a subsequent 'late facilitation', which is considered to reflect activity of slow-conducting and/or indirect corticospinal pathways. In contrast, M1-conditioning produced a 'late dis-facilitation' or even 'late inhibition'. As the late dis-facilitation was only seen following M1- but not CMS-conditioning, it is argued that cortical activation during dynamic tasks is restricted to fast, direct corticospinal projections whereas corticomotoneurons responsible for slow and/or indirectly projecting corticospinal pathways are inhibited. The functional significance of restricting the descending cortical drive to fast corticospinal pathways may be to ensure a temporally focused motor command during the execution of dynamic movements."

Also, we reviewed the initial six studies on AD that presented early findings showing cognitive gains such as in recognition memory and language associated with TMS and tDCS treatment. In addition, we showed that TMS has also been used to assess neuroplasticity changes in AD supporting the notion that cortical excitability is changed in AD due to the neurodegenerative process. Due to the safe profile, cost of these tools, and initial clinical trials results, further studies are warranted in order to replicate and extend the initial findings of rTMS and tDCS as cognitive enhancers in AD. Further trials should explore different targets of stimulation along with different paradigms of stimulation including combination with behavioural interventions."
"Modulating cortico-striatal and thalamo-cortical functional connectivity with transcranial direct current stimulation.","Human brain mapping",2012,650-75,33,Array,Array,21922602,10,"Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a noninvasive brain stimulation technique that has been shown to alter cortical excitability and activity via application of weak direct currents. Beyond intracortical effects, functional imaging as well as behavioral studies are suggesting additional tDCS-driven alterations of subcortical areas, however, direct evidence for such effects is scarce. We aimed to investigate the impact of tDCS on cortico-subcortical functional networks by seed functional connectivity analysis of different striatal and thalamic regions to prove tDCS-induced alterations of the cortico-striato-thalamic circuit. fMRI resting state data sets were acquired immediately before and after 10 min of bipolar tDCS during rest, with the anode/cathode placed over the left primary motor cortex (M1) and the cathode/anode over the contralateral frontopolar cortex. To control for possible placebo effects, an additional sham stimulation session was carried out. Functional coupling between the left thalamus and the ipsilateral primary motor cortex (M1) significantly increased following anodal stimulation over M1. Additionally, functional connectivity between the left caudate nucleus and parietal association cortices was significantly strengthened. In contrast, cathodal tDCS over M1 decreased functional coupling between left M1 and contralateral putamen. In summary, in this study, we show for the first time that tDCS modulates functional connectivity of cortico-striatal and thalamo-cortical circuits. Here we highlight that anodal tDCS over M1 is capable of modulating elements of the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical functional motor circuit."
"Task-specific effects of tDCS-induced cortical excitability changes on cognitive and motor sequence set shifting performance.","PloS one",2011,650-75,6,Array,Array,21909415,9,"In this study, we tested the effects of transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) on two set shifting tasks. Set shifting ability is defined as the capacity to switch between mental sets or actions and requires the activation of a distributed neural network. Thirty healthy subjects (fifteen per site) received anodal, cathodal and sham stimulation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) or the primary motor cortex (M1). We measured set shifting in both cognitive and motor tasks. The results show that both anodal and cathodal single session tDCS can modulate cognitive and motor tasks. However, an interaction was found between task and type of stimulation as anodal tDCS of DLPFC and M1 was found to increase performance in the cognitive task, while cathodal tDCS of DLPFC and M1 had the opposite effect on the motor task. Additionally, tDCS effects seem to be most evident on the speed of changing sets, rather than on reducing the number of errors or increasing the efficacy of irrelevant set filtering."

Here, we tested whether the same network is involved in cognitive processes such as imagined or observed actions. Single pulse TMS of the right and left M1 during rest and during a motor imagery and an action observation task (i.e., an index-thumb pinch grip in both cases) was used to measure corticospinal excitability changes before and after conditioning of the right PC by 10 min of cathodal, anodal, or sham transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Corticospinal excitability was indexed by the size of motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) from the contralateral first dorsal interosseous (FDI; target) and abductor digiti minimi muscle (control) muscles. Results showed selective ipsilateral effects on the M1 excitability, exclusively for motor imagery processes: anodal tDCS enhanced the MEPs' size from the FDI muscle, whereas cathodal tDCS decreased it. Only cathodal tDCS impacted corticospinal facilitation induced by action observation. Sham stimulation was always uneffective. These results suggest that motor imagery, differently from action observation, is sustained by a strictly ipsilateral parieto-motor cortex circuits. Results might have implication for neuromodulatory rehabilitative purposes."

"Ameliorating spatial neglect with non-invasive brain stimulation: from pathophysiological concepts to novel treatment strategies.","Neuropsychological rehabilitation",2011,650-75,21,Array,Array,18950692,5,"Neglect is a multifaceted, complex syndrome, in which patients fail to detect or respond to stimuli or parts thereof located contralesionally. Non-invasive brain stimulation by means of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) or transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) may not only be useful as diagnostic research tools to explore the pathophysiology of neglect, but also for ameliorating its symptoms. Current approaches for modulating neglect non-invasively are mainly based on the neurophysiological concept of interhemispheric inhibition, which suggests a pathological overactivation of the contralesional hemisphere due to reduced inhibitory influences from the lesioned one. Within this framework, non-invasive brain stimulation mainly aims to inhibit the contralesional hemisphere to allow for rebalancing the system. However, facilitatory protocols for enhancing the ipsilesional neural circuitry might also prove useful. In this review, we discuss the contribution of non-invasive brain stimulation to current pathological concepts of neglect, the promising results of the proof-of-principle studies currently available as well as the specific aspects to be systematically investigated before broader clinical trials may eventually suggest a routine clinical application."
"Electrical stimulation over the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) determines long-term effects in the recovery of speech apraxia in three chronic aphasics.","Behavioural brain research",2011,650-75,225,Array,Array,19494149,2,"A number of studies have shown that modulating cortical activity by means of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) affects the performance of both healthy and brain-damaged subjects. In this study, we investigated the potential of tDCS for the recovery of apraxia of speech in 3 patients with stroke-induced aphasia. Over 2 weeks, three aphasic subjects participated in a randomized double-blinded experiment involving intensive language training for their articulatory difficulties in two tDCS conditions. Each subject participated in five consecutive daily sessions of anodic tDCS (20 min, 1 mA) and sham stimulation over the left inferior frontal gyrus (referred to as Broca's area) while they performed a repetition task. By the end of each week, a significant improvement was found in both conditions. However, all three subjects showed greater response accuracy in the anodic than in the sham condition. Moreover, results for transfer of treatment effects, although different across subjects, indicate a generalization of the recovery at the language test. Subjects 2 and 3 showed a significant improvement in oral production tasks, such as word repetition and reading, while Subjects 1 and 2 had an unexpected significant recovery in written naming and word writing under dictation tasks. At three follow-ups (1 week, 1 and 2 months after the end of treatment), response accuracy was still significantly better in the anodic than in sham condition, suggesting a long-term effect on the recovery of their articulatory gestures."
"The phase of ongoing oscillations mediates the causal relation between brain excitation and visual perception.","The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience",2011,650-75,31,Array,Array,19386757,33,"Why does neuronal activity in sensory brain areas sometimes give rise to perception, and sometimes not? Although neuronal noise is often invoked as the key factor, a portion of this variability could also be due to the history and current state of the brain affecting cortical excitability. Here we directly test this idea by examining whether the phase of prestimulus oscillatory activity is causally linked with modulations of cortical excitability and with visual perception. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was applied over human visual cortex to induce illusory perceptions (phosphenes) while electroencephalograms (EEGs) were simultaneously recorded. Subjects reported the presence or absence of an induced phosphene following a single pulse of TMS at perceptual threshold. The phase of ongoing alpha (∼10 Hz) oscillations within 400 ms before the pulse significantly covaried with the perceptual outcome. This effect was observed in occipital regions around the site of TMS, as well as in a distant frontocentral region. In both regions, we found a systematic relationship between prepulse EEG phase and perceptual performance: phosphene probability changed by ∼15% between opposite phases. In summary, we provide direct evidence for a chain of causal relations between the phase of ongoing oscillations, neuronal excitability, and visual perception: ongoing oscillations create periodic ""windows of excitability,"" with sensory perception being more likely to occur at specific phases."
"The use of non-invasive brain stimulation techniques to facilitate recovery from post-stroke aphasia.","Neuropsychology review",2011,650-75,21,Array,Array,21270784,3,"Aphasia is a common symptom after left hemispheric stroke. Neuroimaging techniques over the last 10-15 years have described two general trends: Patients with small left hemisphere strokes tend to recruit perilesional areas, while patients with large left hemisphere lesions recruit mainly homotopic regions in the right hemisphere. Non-invasive brain stimulation techniques such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) have been employed to facilitate recovery by stimulating lesional and contralesional regions. The majority of these brain stimulation studies have attempted to block homotopic regions in the right posterior inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) to affect a presumed disinhibited right IFG (triangular portion). Other studies have used anodal or excitatory tDCS to stimulate the contralesional (right) fronto-temporal region or parts of the intact left IFG and perilesional regions to improve speech-motor output. It remains unclear whether the interhemispheric disinhibition model, which is the basis for motor cortex stimulation studies, also applies to the language system. Future studies could address a number of issues, including: the effect of lesion location on current density distribution, timing of the intervention with regard to stroke onset, whether brain stimulation should be combined with behavioral therapy, and whether multiple brain sites should be stimulated. A better understanding of the predictors of recovery from natural outcome studies would also help to inform study design, and the selection of clinically meaningful outcome measures in future studies."
"Healthy Aging by Staying Selectively Connected: A Mini-Review.",Gerontology,2013,,,Array,Array,24080587,,"Cognitive neuroscience of the healthy aging human brain has thus far addressed age-related changes of local functional and structural properties of gray and white matter and their association with declining or preserved cognitive functions. In addition to these localized changes, recent neuroimaging research has attributed an important role to neural networks with a stronger focus on interacting rather than isolated brain regions. The analysis of functional connectivity encompasses task-dependent and -independent synchronous activity in the brain, and thus reflects the organization of the brain in distinct performance-relevant networks. Structural connectivity in white matter pathways, representing the integrity of anatomical connections, underlies the communication between the nodes of these functional networks. Both functional and structural connectivity within these networks have been demonstrated to change with aging, and to have different predictive values for cognitive abilities in older compared to young adults. Structural degeneration has been found in the entire cerebral white matter with greatest deterioration in frontal areas, affecting whole brain structural network efficiency. With regard to functional connectivity, both higher and lower functional coupling has been observed in the aging compared to the young brain. Here, high connectivity within the nodes of specific functional networks on the one hand, and low connectivity to regions outside this network on the other hand, were associated with preserved cognitive functions in aging in most cases. For example, in the language domain, connections between left-hemisphere language-related prefrontal, posterior temporal and parietal areas were described as beneficial, whereas connections between the left and right hemisphere were detrimental for language task performance. Of note, interactions between structural and functional network properties may change in the course of aging and differentially impact behavioral performance in older versus young adults. Finally, studies using noninvasive brain stimulation techniques like transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to simultaneously modulate behavior and functional connectivity support the importance of 'selective connectivity' of aging brain networks for preserved cognitive functions. These studies demonstrate that enhancing task performance by tDCS is paralleled by increased connectivity within functional networks. In this review, we outline the network perspective on healthy brain aging and discuss recent developments in this field. © 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel."

"Effects of transcranial direct current stimulation on consolidation of fear memory.","Frontiers in psychiatry",2013,,4,Array,Array,24069003,,"We have a limited capacity for mapping sensory information onto motor responses. This processing bottleneck is thought to be a key factor in determining our ability to make two decisions simultaneously - i.e., to multitask (Pashler, 1984, 1994; Welford, 1952). Previous functional imaging research (Dux, Ivanoff, Asplund, & Marois, 2006; Dux et al., 2009) has localised this bottleneck to the posterior lateral prefrontal cortex (pLPFC) of the left hemisphere. Currently, however, it is unknown whether this region is causally involved in multitasking performance. We investigated the role of the left pLPFC in multitasking using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). The behavioural paradigm included single- and dual-task trials, each requiring a speeded discrimination of visual stimuli alone, auditory stimuli alone, or both visual and auditory stimuli. Reaction times for single- and dual-task trials were compared before, immediately after, and 20 min after anodal stimulation (excitatory), cathodal stimulation (inhibitory), or sham stimulation. The cost of responding to the two tasks (i.e., the reduction in performance for dual- vs single-task trials) was significantly reduced by cathodal stimulation, but not by anodal or sham stimulation. Overall, the results provide direct evidence that the left pLPFC is a key neural locus of the central bottleneck that limits an individual's ability to make two simple decisions simultaneously."

A clinical evaluation, a video-taped SARA rating scale and a gait analysis with cinematic parameters, were performed pre- and post-sham and anodal tDCS cycle. The full cycle was composed by five consecutive constant current sessions of stimulation. Anodal tDCS (2.0 mA, 20 min, max current density: 0.0278 mA/cm(2), max total charge: 0.033 C/cm(2)) was performed on the M1 area of the most affected side.

From a neuroscience perspective, the standard application of both transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been mainly to explore the function of various brain regions. These tools allow for noninvasive and painless modulation of cortical tissue. In the course of studying the function of an area, many studies often report enhanced performance of a task during or following the stimulation. However, little follow-up research is typically done to further explore these effects. Approaching this growing pool of cognitive neuroscience literature with a neuroergonomics mindset (i.e., studying the brain at work), the possibilities of using these stimulation techniques for more than simply investigating the function of cortical areas become evident. In this paper, we discuss how cognitive neuroscience brain stimulation studies may complement neuroergonomics research on human performance optimization. And, through this discussion, we hope to shift the mindset of viewing transcranial stimulation techniques as solely investigatory basic science tools or possible clinical therapeutic devices to viewing transcranial stimulation techniques as interventional tools to be incorporated in applied science research and systems for the augmentation and enhancement of human operator performance."

Recently, in a subgroup of tinnitus patients, temporary reduction of tinnitus intensity and tinnitus-related distress has been reported after bifrontal tDCS with the anode over the right and the cathode over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). The aim of this study was to investigate whether repeated application of bifrontal tDCS results in longer-lasting reduction of tinnitus and may represent a potential treatment approach.

Probabilistic association learning, involving a gradual learning of cue-outcome associations, activates a frontal-striatal network in healthy adults. Studies of probabilistic association learning in schizophrenia have shown frontal-striatal dysfunction although considerable heterogeneity in performance has also been reported. Anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex has been shown to improve probabilistic association learning in healthy adults. The aim of the current study was to determine the extent to which anodal tDCS to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex would reverse probabilistic association learning deficits in schizophrenia. Prior to tDCS, 20 people with schizophrenia performed an initial baseline assessment without stimulation. Anodal tDCS was administered continuously for 20 min at an intensity of 2.0 mA to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in a single-blind, counterbalanced, sham-controlled, cross-over design while participants performed 150 trials of a probabilistic association learning test. Although anodal tDCS failed to improve probabilistic association learning based on the whole sample performance, greater variance in the active relative to the sham conditions suggested a subset of people may respond to treatment. Further correlation, regression and cluster analyses revealed differential effects of baseline performance on active tDCS and sham treatment and that there was a subset of people with schizophrenia who displayed improvement with tDCS suggesting that anodal tDCS to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex may facilitate access to existing prefrontal cortex neural reserves in people with schizophrenia who show adequate capacity to learn at baseline."
"Uncovering Multisensory Processing through Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation.","Frontiers in psychology",2011,198-205,2,Array,Array,21716922,,"Most of current knowledge about the mechanisms of multisensory integration of environmental stimuli by the human brain derives from neuroimaging experiments. However, neuroimaging studies do not always provide conclusive evidence about the causal role of a given area for multisensory interactions, since these techniques can mainly derive correlations between brain activations and behavior. Conversely, techniques of non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) represent a unique and powerful approach to inform models of causal relations between specific brain regions and individual cognitive and perceptual functions. Although NIBS has been widely used in cognitive neuroscience, its use in the study of multisensory processing in the human brain appears a quite novel field of research. In this paper, we review and discuss recent studies that have used two techniques of NIBS, namely transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial direct current stimulation, for investigating the causal involvement of unisensory and heteromodal cortical areas in multisensory processing, the effects of multisensory cues on cortical excitability in unisensory areas, and the putative functional connections among different cortical areas subserving multisensory interactions. The emerging view is that NIBS is an essential tool available to neuroscientists seeking for causal relationships between a given area or network and multisensory processes. With its already large and fast increasing usage, future work using NIBS in isolation, as well as in conjunction with different neuroimaging techniques, could substantially improve our understanding of multisensory processing in the human brain."
"Probing of Brain States in Real-Time: Introducing the ConSole Environment.","Frontiers in psychology",2011,198-205,2,Array,Array,16182596,,"Recent years have seen huge advancements in the methods available and used in neuroscience employing EEG or MEG. However, the standard approach is to average a large number of trials for experimentally defined conditions in order to reduce intertrial-variability, i.e., treating it as a source of ""noise."" Yet it is now more and more accepted that trial-to-trial fluctuations bear functional significance, reflecting fluctuations of ""brain states"" that predispose perception and action. Such effects are often revealed in a pre-stimulus period, when comparing response variability to an invariant stimulus. However such offline analyses are disadvantageous as they are correlational by drawing conclusions in a post hoc-manner and stimulus presentation is random with respect to the feature of interest. A more direct test is to trigger stimulus presentation when the relevant feature is present. The current paper introduces Constance System for Online EEG (ConSole), a software package capable of analyzing ongoing EEG/MEG in real-time and presenting auditory and visual stimuli via internal routines. Stimulation via external devices (e.g., transcranial magnetic stimulation) or third-party software (e.g., PsyScope X) is possible by sending TTL-triggers. With ConSole it is thus possible to target the stimulation at specific brain states. In contrast to many available applications, ConSole is open-source. Its modular design enhances the power of the software as it can be easily adapted to new challenges and writing new experiments is an easy task. ConSole is already pre-equipped with modules performing standard signal processing steps. The software is also independent from the EEG/MEG system, as long as a driver can be written (currently two EEG systems are supported). Besides a general introduction, we present benchmark data regarding performance and validity of the calculations used, as well as three example applications of ConSole in different settings.

The present study examined the effects of TDCS delivered at the beginning of training (novice) or after an hour of training (experienced) on participants' ability to detect cues indicative of covert threats. Participants completed two 1-h training sessions. During the first 30 min of each training session, either 0.1 mA or 2.0 mA of anodal TDCS was delivered to the participant. The anode was positioned near F8, and the cathode was placed on the upper left arm. Testing trials immediately followed training. Accuracy in classification of images containing and not-containing threat stimuli during the testing sessions indicated: (1) that mastery of threat detection significantly increased with training, (2) that anodal TDCS at 2 mA significantly enhanced learning, and (3) TDCS was significantly more effective in enhancing test performance when applied in novice learners than in experienced learners. The enhanced performance following training with TDCS persisted into the second session when TDCS was delivered early in training."

Manipulating brain activity by transcranial stimulation, however, inevitably influences other control centers of various neuronal and neurohormonal feedback loops and therefore may concomitantly affect systemic metabolic regulation. Because hypothalamic adenosine triphosphate-sensitive potassium channels, which function as local energy sensors, are centrally involved in the regulation of glucose homeostasis, we tested whether transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) causes an excitation-induced transient neuronal energy depletion and thus influences systemic glucose homeostasis and related neuroendocrine mediators."

We used regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), a surrogate measure of brain activity, to examine regional brain-tissue and brain-network effects during and after tDCS. We varied the polarity (anodal and cathodal) as well as the current strength (0.8 to 2.0mA) of the stimulation. Fourteen healthy subjects were randomized into receiving either anodal or cathodal stimulation (two subjects received both, one week apart) while undergoing Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) in the MRI scanner with an alternating off-on sampling paradigm. The stimulating, MRI-compatible electrode was placed over the right motor region and the reference electrode over the contralateral supra-orbital region. SPM5 was used to process and extract the rCBF data using a 10mm spherical volume of interest (VOI) placed in the motor cortex directly underneath the stimulating scalp electrode. Anodal stimulation induced a large increase (17.1%) in rCBF during stimulation, which returned to baseline after the current was turned off, but exhibited an increase in rCBF again in the post-stimulation period. Cathodal stimulation induced a smaller increase (5.6%) during stimulation, a significant decrease compared to baseline (-6.5%) after cessation, and a continued decrease in the post-stimulation period. These changes in rCBF were all significant when compared to the pre-stimulation baseline or to a control region. Furthermore, for anodal stimulation, there was a significant correlation between current strength and the increase in rCBF in the on-period relative to the pre-stimulation baseline. The differential rCBF after-effects of anodal (increase in resting state rCBF) and cathodal (decrease in resting state rCBF) tDCS support findings of behavioral and cognitive after-effects after cathodal and anodal tDCS. We also show that tDCS not only modulates activity in the brain region directly underlying the stimulating electrode but also in a network of brain regions that are functionally related to the stimulated area. Our results indicate that ASL may be an excellent tool to investigate the effects of tDCS and its stimulation parameters on brain activity."

Each subject participated in a randomized and balanced order in 1 session of anodal tDCS and 1 session of sham stimulation, in a double-blind design with 2 parallel versions of the task. Outcome measures were learning success at the end of each session, and immediate as well as delayed (1 week) free recall. We found that subjects performed comparably in the learning task in the 2 conditions, but showed improved recall 1 week after learning with anodal tDCS compared with learning with sham stimulation.

The mechanisms by which tDCS produces these behavioral effects are currently uncertain. One hypothesis is that anodal tDCS leads to increased metabolic activity in the brain, which enhances cognitive and memory processes. Here we examined the neuronal mechanisms by which tDCS influences learning by measuring changes in brain metabolite concentrations using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (¹H MRS). As perception and learning can also influence neurochemistry, here we applied tDCS during rest. MRS data was obtained before and after 2.0 mA of anodal tDCS was applied for 30 min over electrode site P4, with the cathode placed on the contralateral arm. MRS data were acquired from the right parietal lobe beneath the anodal tDCS electrode, and from the homologous regions of the left hemisphere once before and once after tDCS. Significantly higher combined glutamate and glutamine levels were found in right parietal cortex, beneath the stimulating electrode, with non-significant increases in homologous regions of the opposite hemisphere. In addition, a significant interaction between hemispheres was found for tDCS effects on tNAA. These results suggest that changes in glutamatergic activity and tNAA may be related to the mechanisms by which tDCS influences learning and behavior."

Top-down control processes that both guide the selection of internal information relevant to LTM goals and resolve interference on retrieval from irrelevant external information have been associated with the same region in left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC). The current study examined a causal role of the left VLPFC in memory performance when external distraction (i.e., visual stimuli irrelevant to the current task goals) was presented during retrieval of LTM. Immediately after functional perturbation of the left VLPFC with 1-Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, participants' memory was tested when their eyes were closed and when their eyes were open and irrelevant visual stimuli were presented. The results showed that visual distraction diminished LTM performance based on an objective measure of recollection and that perturbation of left VLPFC exacerbated the disruptive effect. This is the first evidence of a direct role of the left VLPFC in diminishing the impact of distraction on recollection, elucidating neural mechanisms that are critically involved in how we reconstruct the past while navigating the external environment."

Non-invasive brain stimulation such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) have been shown to modulate excitability in the brain. Moreover, rTMS and tDCS have been found to improve naming in non-fluent post-stroke aphasic patients.

We hypothesized that tDCS applied to the left superior temporal gyrus (Wernicke's area) or the right Wernicke's area might be associated with recovery of comprehension ability in aphasic patients with subacute stroke. Participants included right-handed subacute stroke patients with global aphasia due to ischemic infarct of the left M1 or M2 middle cerebral artery. Patients were randomly divided into three groups: patients who received anodal tDCS applied to the left superior temporal gyrus, patients who received cathodal tDCS applied to the right superior temporal gyrus, and patients who received sham tDCS. All patients received conventional speech and language therapy during each period of tDCS application. The Korean-Western Aphasia Battery (K-WAB) was used to assess all patients before and after tDCS sessions. After intervention, all patients had significant improvements in aphasia quotients, spontaneous speech, and auditory verbal comprehension. However, auditory verbal comprehension improved significantly more in patients treated with a cathode, as compared to patients in the other groups.

Although shifts on focal brain excitability have been proposed to explain the clinical effects of tDCS, how tDCS-induced functional changes influence cortical interneurones is still largely unknown. The assessment of short latency afferent inhibition (SLAI) of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), provides the opportunity to test non-invasively interneuronal cholinergic circuits in the human motor cortex. The aim of the present study was to assess whether anodal tDCS can modulate interneuronal circuits involved in SLAI. Resting motor threshold (RMT), amplitude of unconditioned MEPs and SLAI were assessed in the dominant hemisphere of 12 healthy subjects (aged 21-37) before and after anodal tDCS (primary motor cortex, 13min, 1mA). SLAI was assessed delivering electrical conditioning stimuli to the median nerve at the wrist prior to test TMS given at the interstimulus interval (ISI) of 2ms. Whereas RMT and the amplitude of unconditioned MEPs did not change after anodal tDCS, SLAI significantly increased. In conclusion, anodal tDCS-induced effects depend also on the modulation of cortical interneuronal circuits. The enhancement of cortical cholinergic activity assessed by SLAI could be an important mechanism explaining anodal tDCS action in several pathological conditions."

Reach adaptation in force fields has generalization patterns that suggest primary engagement of a neural system that encodes movements in the intrinsic coordinates of joints and muscles, and lesser engagement of a neural system that encodes movements in the extrinsic coordinates of the task. Among the cortical motor areas, the intrinsic coordinate system is most prominently represented in the primary sensorimotor cortices. Here, we used transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to alter mechanisms of synaptic plasticity and found that when it was applied to the motor cortex, it increased generalization in intrinsic coordinates but not extrinsic coordinates. However, when tDCS was applied to the posterior parietal cortex, it had no effects on learning or generalization in the force field task.

Imaging studies performed after unilateral stimulation have shown conflicting results regarding the effects of tDCS on surrogate markers of neuronal activity. The aim of this study was to directly measure these effects on activation-induced changes in regional cerebral blood flow (ΔrCBF) using positron emission tomography (PET) during bilateral tDCS. Nine healthy subjects underwent repeated rCBF measurements with (15)O-water and PET during a simple motor task while receiving tDCS or sham stimulation over the primary motor cortex (M1). Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were also assessed before and after real and sham stimulation. During tDCS with active movement, ΔrCBF in M1 was significantly lower on the cathodal than the anodal side when compared with sham stimulation. This decrease in ΔrCBF was accompanied by a decrease in MEP amplitude on the cathodal side. No effect was observed on resting or activated rCBF relative to sham stimulation. We thus conclude that it is the interaction of cathodal tDCS with activation-induced ΔrCBF rather than the effect on resting or activated rCBF itself which constitutes the physiological imaging correlate of tDCS."

We examined whether diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)-derived measures of corticospinal and transcallosal tracts predict motor improvement in an experimental neurorehabilitation trial. 15 chronic stroke patients received bihemispheric transcranial direct current stimulation and simultaneous physical/occupational therapy for five consecutive days. Motor impairment was assessed prior to and after the intervention. At baseline, the patients underwent DTI; probabilistic fiber tracking was used to reconstruct the pyramidal tract (PT), alternate descending motor fibers (aMF), and transcallosal fibers connecting primary motor cortices (M1-M1). Ipsilesional corticospinal tracts (PT, aMF) and M1-M1 showed significantly decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) and increased directional diffusivities when compared to age-matched healthy controls. Partial correlations revealed that greater gains in motor function were related to higher FA values and lower directional diffusivities of transcallosal and ipsilesional corticospinal tracts. M1-M1 diffusivity had the greatest predictive value. An additional slice-by-slice analysis of FA values along the corticospinal tracts demonstrated that the more the ipsilesional FA profiles of patients resembled those of healthy controls, the greater their functional improvement. In conclusion, our study shows that DTI-derived measures can be used to predict functional potential for subsequent motor recovery in chronic stroke patients. Diffusivity parameters of individual tracts and tract combinations may help in assessing a patient's individual recovery potential and in determining optimal neurorehabilitative interventions."
"Cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation of the primary motor cortex improves selective muscle activation in the ipsilateral arm.","Journal of neurophysiology",2011,167-70,105,Array,Array,19945398,6,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) trials - investigating either non-pharmacological or pharmacological interventions - have shown mixed results. Many reasons explain this heterogeneity, but one that stands out is the trial design due to specific challenges in the field. We aimed therefore to review the methodology of non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) trials and provide a framework to improve clinical trial design. We performed a systematic review for randomized, controlled MDD trials whose intervention was transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) or transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in MEDLINE and other databases from April 2002 to April 2008. We created an unstructured checklist based on CONSORT guidelines to extract items such as power analysis, sham method, blinding assessment, allocation concealment, operational criteria used for MDD, definition of refractory depression and primary study hypotheses. Thirty-one studies were included. We found that the main methodological issues can be divided in to three groups: (1) issues related to phase II/small trials, (2) issues related to MDD trials and, (3) specific issues of NIBS studies. Taken together, they can threaten study validity and lead to inconclusive results. Feasible solutions include: estimating the sample size a priori; measuring the degree of refractoriness of the subjects; specifying the primary hypothesis and statistical tests; controlling predictor variables through stratification randomization methods or using strict eligibility criteria; adjusting the study design to the target population; using adaptive designs and exploring NIBS efficacy employing biological markers. In conclusion, our study summarizes the main methodological issues of NIBS trials and proposes a number of alternatives to manage them."

The effects of anodal tDCS were evaluated in six subjects and the effects of cathodal tDCS in five subjects. Three subjects were studied with both polarities. Anodal tDCS increased the excitability of cortical circuits generating I waves in the corticospinal system, including the earliest wave (I1 wave), whereas cathodal tDCS suppressed later I waves. The motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude changes immediately following tDCS periods were in agreement with the effects produced on intracortical circuitry. The results deliver additional evidence that tDCS changes the excitability of cortical neurons."
"When anger leads to aggression: induction of relative left frontal cortical activity with transcranial direct current stimulation increases the anger-aggression relationship.","Social cognitive and affective neuroscience",2012,2802-10,7,Array,Array,21421731,3,"The relationship between anger and aggression is imperfect. Based on work on the neuroscience of anger, we predicted that anger associated with greater relative left frontal cortical activation would be more likely to result in aggression. To test this hypothesis, we combined transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the frontal cortex with interpersonal provocation. Participants received insulting feedback after 15 min of tDCS and were able to aggress by administering noise blasts to the insulting participant. Individuals who received tDCS to increase relative left frontal cortical activity behaved more aggressively when they were angry. No relation between anger and aggression was observed in the increase relative right frontal cortical activity or sham condition. These results concur with the motivational direction model of frontal asymmetry, in which left frontal activity is associated with anger. We propose that anger with approach motivational tendencies is more likely to result in aggression."

"Transcranial electrical currents to probe EEG brain rhythms and memory consolidation during sleep in humans.","PloS one",2011,e16905,6,Array,Array,21340034,2,"Previously the application of a weak electric anodal current oscillating with a frequency of the sleep slow oscillation (∼0.75 Hz) during non-rapid eye movement sleep (NonREM) sleep boosted endogenous slow oscillation activity and enhanced sleep-associated memory consolidation. The slow oscillations occurring during NonREM sleep and theta oscillations present during REM sleep have been considered of critical relevance for memory formation. Here transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) oscillating at 5 Hz, i.e., within the theta frequency range (theta-tDCS) is applied during NonREM and REM sleep. Theta-tDCS during NonREM sleep produced a global decrease in slow oscillatory activity conjoint with a local reduction of frontal slow EEG spindle power (8-12 Hz) and a decrement in consolidation of declarative memory, underlining the relevance of these cortical oscillations for sleep-dependent memory consolidation. In contrast, during REM sleep theta-tDCS appears to increase global gamma (25-45 Hz) activity, indicating a clear brain state-dependency of theta-tDCS. More generally, results demonstrate the suitability of oscillating-tDCS as a tool to analyze functions of endogenous EEG rhythms and underlying endogenous electric fields as well as the interactions between EEG rhythms of different frequencies."

A numerical method was applied on a realistic human head model to calculate these field distributions in different brain structures, such as the cortex, the white matter, the cerebellum, the hippocampus, the medulla oblongata, the pons, the midbrain, and the thalamus. The influence of varying the anode area, the cathode area, and the injected current was also investigated. An electrode area as the one typically used in clinical practice (i.e., both electrodes equal to 35 cm(2)) resulted into complex and diffuse amplitude distributions over all the examined brain structures, with the region of maximum induced field being below or close to the anode. Variations in either the anode or cathode area corresponded to changes in the field amplitude distribution in all the brain tissues, with the former variation producing more diffuse effects. Variations in the injected current resulted, as could be expected, in linearly correlated changes in the field amplitudes."
"Polarity and timing-dependent effects of transcranial direct current stimulation in explicit motor learning.",Neuropsychologia,2011,e16905,49,Array,Array,4340452,5,"Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is attracting increasing interest as a therapeutic tool for neurorehabilitation, particularly after stroke, because of its potential to modulate local excitability and therefore promote functional plasticity. Previous studies suggest that timing is important in determining the behavioural effects of brain stimulation. Regulatory metaplastic mechanisms exist to modulate the effects of a stimulation intervention in a manner dependent on prior cortical excitability, thereby preventing destabilization of existing cortical networks. The importance of such timing dependence has not yet been fully explored for tDCS. Here, we describe the results of a series of behavioural experiments in healthy controls to determine the importance of the relative timing of tDCS for motor performance. Application of tDCS during an explicit sequence-learning task led to modulation of behaviour in a polarity specific manner: relative to sham stimulation, anodal tDCS was associated with faster learning and cathodal tDCS with slower learning. Application of tDCS prior to performance of the sequence-learning task led to slower learning after both anodal and cathodal tDCS. By contrast, regardless of the polarity of stimulation, tDCS had no significant effect on performance of a simple reaction time task. These results are consistent with the idea that anodal tDCS interacts with subsequent motor learning in a metaplastic manner and suggest that anodal stimulation modulates cortical excitability in a manner similar to motor learning."
"A systematic review on reporting and assessment of adverse effects associated with transcranial direct current stimulation.","The international journal of neuropsychopharmacology / official scientific journal of the Collegium Internationale Neuropsychopharmacologicum (CINP)",2011,e16905,14,Array,Array,17905642,8,"Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive method of brain stimulation that has been intensively investigated in clinical and cognitive neuroscience. Although the general impression is that tDCS is a safe technique with mild and transient adverse effects (AEs), human data on safety and tolerability are largely provided from single-session studies in healthy volunteers. In addition the frequency of AEs and its relationship with clinical variables is unknown. With the aim of assessing tDCS safety in different conditions and study designs, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of tDCS clinical trials. We assessed Medline and other databases and reference lists from retrieved articles, searching for articles from 1998 (first trial with contemporary tDCS parameters) to August 2010. Animal studies, review articles and studies assessing other neuromodulatory techniques were excluded. According to our eligibility criteria, 209 studies (from 172 articles) were identified. One hundred and seventeen studies (56%) mentioned AEs in the report. Of these studies, 74 (63%) reported at least one AE and only eight studies quantified AEs systematically. In the subsample reporting AEs, the most common were, for active vs. sham tDCS group, itching (39.3% vs. 32.9%, p>0.05), tingling (22.2% vs. 18.3%, p>0.05), headache (14.8% vs. 16.2%, p>0.05), burning sensation (8.7% vs. 10%, p>0.05) and discomfort (10.4% vs. 13.4%, p>0.05). Meta-analytical techniques could be applied in only eight studies for itching, but no definite results could be obtained due to between-study heterogeneity and low number of studies. Our results suggested that some AEs such as itching and tingling were more frequent in the tDCS active group, although this was not statistically significant. Although results suggest that tDCS is associated with mild AEs only, we identified a selective reporting bias for reporting, assessing and publishing AEs of tDCS that hinders further conclusions. Based on our findings, we propose a revised adverse effects questionnaire to be applied in tDCS studies in order to improve systematic reporting of tDCS-related AEs."
"Facilitate insight by non-invasive brain stimulation.","PloS one",2011,e16905,6,Array,Array,18824212,2,"Our experiences can blind us. Once we have learned to solve problems by one method, we often have difficulties in generating solutions involving a different kind of insight. Yet there is evidence that people with brain lesions are sometimes more resistant to this so-called mental set effect. This inspired us to investigate whether the mental set effect can be reduced by non-invasive brain stimulation. 60 healthy right-handed participants were asked to take an insight problem solving task while receiving transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to the anterior temporal lobes (ATL). Only 20% of participants solved an insight problem with sham stimulation (control), whereas 3 times as many participants did so (p = 0.011) with cathodal stimulation (decreased excitability) of the left ATL together with anodal stimulation (increased excitability) of the right ATL. We found hemispheric differences in that a stimulation montage involving the opposite polarities did not facilitate performance. Our findings are consistent with the theory that inhibition to the left ATL can lead to a cognitive style that is less influenced by mental templates and that the right ATL may be associated with insight or novel meaning. Further studies including neurophysiological imaging are needed to elucidate the specific mechanisms leading to the enhancement."

New insights into the role of activity-dependent motor recovery have guided clinicians to develop novel task-oriented therapies that are effective in reducing functional limitations in hand use after stroke.

Cortical stimulation with the use of either noninvasive techniques or implanted technology has shown some promise as an adjuvant therapy but has yet to be supported in well-designed clinical trials. In this article, we review the physiology of neural plasticity and of cortical stimulation. Laboratory studies and early clinical trials of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, transcranial direct current stimulation, and epidural cortical stimulation are reported. Cortical stimulation may have a role in facilitating motor recovery after stroke, but a better understanding of the physics of cortical stimulation, biological response to stimulation, effective stimulation protocols, and proper patient selection is needed."

"Anodal tDCS over SMA decreases the probability of withholding an anticipated action.","Behavioural brain research",2013,208-14,257,Array,Array,24064279,,"Previous research has shown that the supplementary motor area (SMA) is critical in movement inhibition. Recently it was shown that applying transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over SMA affected participants' ability to inhibit their movement in a stop-signal reaction time task (Hsu et al. [11]). Of interest in the current study was whether modulating SMA excitability using tDCS would have similar effects in an anticipation-timing stop-signal task. Participants performed 2 sessions each consisting of a pre- and post-tDCS block of 160 trials in which they were instructed to extend their wrist concurrently with the arrival of a pointer to a target (i.e., a clock hand reaching a set position). In 20% of trials (stop trials) the pointer stopped 80, 110, 140, 170, or 200ms prior to the target, and on these trials participants were instructed to inhibit their movement if possible. Anodal and cathodal tDCS (separated by at least 48h) was applied for each participant between the pre- and post-tDCS blocks. No change in the proportion of successfully inhibited movements on stop trials was found following cathodal tDCS (p>.05). However, anodal tDCS resulted in a decreased proportion of successfully inhibited movements on stop trials (p=002), and an earlier movement onset on control trials (p<.01). This suggests that the SMA may be more involved in initiation than in inhibition of anticipatory movements. Furthermore these data suggest that differences in initiation and inhibitory processes exist between stop-signal reaction time and anticipation-timing stop-signal tasks."

Difficulties in verbal episodic memory commonly occur in healthy aging. In this paper, we assess the hypothesis that anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) applied over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) or over the parietal cortex (PARC) could facilitate verbal episodic memory in a group of 32 healthy older adults and in a group of 32 young subjects relative to a sham stimulation using a single-blind randomized controlled design. Each participant underwent two sessions of anodal tDCS (left and right) and one session of sham stimulation. Overall, our results demonstrated that, in young and in older subjects, anodal tDCS applied during the retrieval phase facilitates verbal episodic memory. In particular, we found that tDCS applied over the left and right regions (DLPFC and PARC) induced better performance in young participants; only tDCS applied over the left regions (DLPFC and PARC) increased retrieval in older subjects. These results suggest that anodal tDCS can be a relevant tool to modulate the long-term episodic memory capacities of young and older subjects."
"Modulation of cortical-subcortical networks in Parkinson's disease by applied field effects.","Frontiers in human neuroscience",2013,208-14,7,Array,Array,24062667,,"Studies suggest that endogenous field effects may play a role in neuronal oscillations and communication. Non-invasive transcranial electrical stimulation with low-intensity currents can also have direct effects on the underlying cortex as well as distant network effects. While Parkinson's disease (PD) is amenable to invasive neuromodulation in the basal ganglia by deep brain stimulation (DBS), techniques of non-invasive neuromodulation like transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) are being investigated as possible therapies. tDCS and tACS have the potential to influence the abnormal cortical-subcortical network activity that occurs in PD through sub-threshold changes in cortical excitability or through entrainment or disruption of ongoing rhythmic cortical activity. This may allow for the targeting of specific features of the disease involving abnormal oscillatory activity, as well as the enhancement of potential cortical compensation for basal ganglia dysfunction and modulation of cortical plasticity in neurorehabilitation. However, little is currently known about how cortical stimulation will affect subcortical structures, the size of any effect, and the factors of stimulation that will influence these effects."
"What the online manipulation of linguistic activity can tell us about language and thought.","Frontiers in behavioral neuroscience",2013,208-14,7,Array,Array,24062653,,"Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a promising therapy for major depression treatment, although little is known of its effects in ameliorating distinct symptoms of depression. Thus, it is important, not only to increase knowledge of its antidepressant mechanisms, but also to guide its potential use in clinical practice. Using data from a recent factorial, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial applying tDCS-alone and combined with sertraline to treat 120 depressed outpatients over 6 wk (Brunoni et al., 2013), we investigated the pattern of improvement in symptoms of depression from the Montgomery-Asberg depression scale (MADRS). First, we performed one multivariate analysis of variance with the score improvement of the 10 MADRS items as dependent variables. Significant (p < 0.05) results were further explored with follow-up analyses of variance. TDCS (alone and combined with sertraline) improved concentration difficulties and pessimistic and suicidal thoughts. The combined treatment also improved apparent and reported sadness, lassitude and inability to feel. Indeed, tDCS/sertraline significantly ameliorated all but the 'vegetative' depression symptoms (inner tension, sleep and appetite items). We further discuss whether bifrontal tDCS over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex could be associated with improvement in cognitive (concentration) and affective (pessimistic/suicidal thoughts) processing, while the combined treatment might have a more widespread antidepressant effect by simultaneously acting on different depression pathways. We also identified patterns of antidepressant improvement for tDCS that might aid in tailoring specific interventions for different subtypes of depressed patients, e.g. particularly those with suicidal ideation."

"Non-invasive brain stimulation: enhancing motor and cognitive functions in healthy old subjects.","Frontiers in aging neuroscience",2010,2,2,Array,Array,15819988,,"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a complex, heterogeneous disorder that develops following trauma and often includes perceptual, cognitive, affective, physiological, and psychological features. PTSD is characterized by hyperarousal, intrusive thoughts, exaggerated startle response, flashbacks, nightmares, sleep disturbances, emotional numbness, and persistent avoidance of trauma-associated stimuli. The efficacy of available treatments for PTSD may result in part from relief of associated depressive and anxiety-related symptoms in addition to treatment of core symptoms that derive from reexperiencing, numbing, and hyperarousal. Diverse, heterogeneous mechanisms of action and the ability to act broadly or very locally may enable brain stimulation devices to address PTSD core symptoms in more targeted ways. To achieve this goal, specific theoretical bases derived from novel, well-designed research protocols will be necessary. Brain stimulation devices include both long-used and new electrical and magnetic devices. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and Cranial electrotherapy stimulation (CES) have both been in use for decades; transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), magnetic seizure therapy (MST), deep brain stimulation (DBS), transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS), and vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) have been developed recently, over approximately the past twenty years. The efficacy of brain stimulation has been demonstrated as a treatment for psychiatric and neurological disorders such as anxiety (CES), depression (ECT, CES, rTMS, VNS, DBS), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) (DBS), essential tremor, dystonia (DBS), epilepsy (DBS, VNS), Parkinson Disease (DBS), pain (CES), and insomnia (CES). To date, limited data on brain stimulation for PTSD offer only modest guidance. ECT has shown some efficacy in reducing comorbid depression in PTSD patients but has not been demonstrated to improve most core PTSD symptoms. CES and VNS have shown some efficacy in reducing anxiety, findings that may suggest possible utility in relieving PTSD-associated anxiety. Treatment of animal models of PTSD with DBS suggests potential human benefit. Additional research and novel treatment options for PTSD are urgently needed. The potential usefulness of brain stimulation in treating PTSD deserves further exploration."
"Enhancement of precise hand movement by transcranial direct current stimulation.",Neuroreport,2011,2,22,Array,Array,15967528,2,"Several mechanisms have been proposed that control the amount of plasticity in neuronal circuits and guarantee dynamic stability of neuronal networks. Homeostatic plasticity suggests that the ease with which a synaptic connection is facilitated/suppressed depends on the previous amount of network activity. We describe how such homeostatic-like interactions depend on the time interval between two conditioning protocols and on the duration of the preconditioning protocol. We used transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to produce short-lasting plasticity in the motor cortex of healthy humans. In the main experiment, we compared the aftereffect of a single 5-min session of anodal or cathodal tDCS with the effect of a 5-min tDCS session preceded by an identical 5-min conditioning session administered 30, 3, or 0 min beforehand. Five-minute anodal tDCS increases excitability for about 5 min. The same duration of cathodal tDCS reduces excitability. Increasing the duration of tDCS to 10 min prolongs the duration of the effects. If two 5-min periods of tDCS are applied with a 30-min break between them, the effect of the second period of tDCS is identical to that of 5-min stimulation alone. If the break is only 3 min, then the second session has the opposite effect to 5-min tDCS given alone. Control experiments show that these shifts in the direction of plasticity evolve during the 10 min after the first tDCS session and depend on the duration of the first tDCS but not on intracortical inhibition and facilitation. The results are compatible with a time-dependent ""homeostatic-like"" rule governing the response of the human motor cortex to plasticity probing protocols."
"Transcranial magnetic stimulation in different current directions activates separate cortical circuits.","Journal of neurophysiology",2011,2,105,Array,Array,16045502,2,"We set out to answer two questions with this study: 1. Can stroke patients improve voluntary control of their paretic ankle by practising a visuo-motor ankle-tracking task? 2. Are practice effects enhanced with non-invasive brain stimulation? A carefully selected sample of chronic stroke patients able to perform the experimental task attended three data collection sessions. Facilitatory transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) was applied in a random order over the lower limb primary motor cortex of the lesioned hemisphere or the non-lesioned hemisphere or sham stimulation was delivered over the lesioned hemisphere. In each session, tDCS was applied as patients practiced tracking a sinusoidal waveform for 15 min using dorsiflexion-plantarflexion movements of their paretic ankle. The difference in tracking error prior to, and after, the 15 min of practice was calculated. A practice effect was revealed following sham stimulation, and this effect was enhanced with tDCS applied over the lesioned hemisphere. The practice effect observed following sham stimulation was eliminated by tDCS applied over the non-lesioned hemisphere. The study provides the first evidence that non-invasive brain stimulation applied to the lesioned motor cortex of moderate- to well-recovered stroke patients enhances voluntary control of the paretic ankle. The results provide a basis for examining whether this enhanced ankle control can be induced in patients with greater impairments and whether enhanced control of a single or multiple lower limb joints improves hemiparetic gait patterns."

"TDCS guided using fMRI significantly accelerates learning to identify concealed objects.",NeuroImage,2012,322-7,59,Array,Array,16221842,1,"Prefrontal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) with the anode placed on the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) has been reported to enhance working memory in healthy subjects and to improve mood in major depression. However, its putative antidepressant, cognitive and behavior action is not well understood. Here, we evaluated the distribution of neuronal electrical activity changes after anodal tDCS of the left DLPFC and cathodal tDCS of the right supraorbital region using spectral power analysis and standardized low resolution tomography (sLORETA). Ten healthy subjects underwent real and sham tDCS on separate days in a double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over trial. Anodal tDCS was applied for 20 min at 2 mA intensity over the left DLPFC, while the cathode was positioned over the contralateral supraorbital region. After tDCS, EEG was recorded during an eyes-closed resting state followed by a working memory (n-back) task. Statistical non-parametric mapping showed reduced left frontal delta activity in the real tDCS condition. Specifically, a significant reduction of mean current densities (sLORETA) for the delta band was detected in the left subgenual PFC, the anterior cingulate and in the left medial frontal gyrus. Moreover, the effect was strongest for the first 5 min (p<0.01). The following n-back task revealed a positive impact of prefrontal tDCS on error rate, accuracy and reaction time. This was accompanied by increased P2- and P3- event-related potentials (ERP) component-amplitudes for the 2-back condition at the electrode Fz. A source localization using sLORETA for the time window 250-450 ms showed enhanced activity in the left parahippocampal gyrus for the 2-back condition. These results suggest that anodal tDCS of the left DLPFC and/or cathodal tDCS of the contralateral supraorbital region may modulate regional electrical activity in the prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex in addition to improving working memory performance."

Computational and behavioral studies have suggested that acquisition and retention of a new visuomotor transformation are distinct processes. However, this dissociation has never been clearly shown. Here, participants made fast reaching movements while unexpectedly a 30-degree visuomotor transformation was introduced. During visuomotor adaptation, subjects received cerebellar, primary motor cortex (M1) or sham anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a noninvasive form of brain stimulation known to increase excitability. We found that cerebellar tDCS caused faster adaptation to the visuomotor transformation, as shown by a rapid reduction of movement errors. These findings were not present with similar modulation of visual cortex excitability. In contrast, tDCS over M1 did not affect adaptation, but resulted in a marked increase in retention of the newly learnt visuomotor transformation. These results show a clear dissociation in the processes of acquisition and retention during adaptive motor learning and demonstrate that the cerebellum and primary motor cortex have distinct functional roles. Furthermore, they show that is possible to enhance cerebellar function using tDCS."

Here we used transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) guided using neuroimaging to increase learning rate in a novel, minimally guided discovery-learning paradigm. Ninety-six subjects identified threat-related objects concealed in naturalistic virtual surroundings used in real-world training. A variety of brain networks were found using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data collected at different stages of learning, with two of these networks focused in right inferior frontal and right parietal cortex. Anodal 2.0 mA tDCS performed for 30 min over these regions in a series of single-blind, randomized studies resulted in significant improvements in learning and performance compared with 0.1 mA tDCS. This difference in performance increased to a factor of two after a one-hour delay. A dose-response effect of current strength on learning was also found. Taken together, these brain imaging and stimulation studies suggest that right frontal and parietal cortex are involved in learning to identify concealed objects in naturalistic surroundings. Furthermore, they suggest that the application of anodal tDCS over these regions can greatly increase learning, resulting in one of the largest effects on learning yet reported. The methods developed here may be useful to decrease the time required to attain expertise in a variety of settings."

In this work, we investigated the feasibility of using noninvasive stimulation to the parietal lobe during numerical learning to selectively improve numerical abilities. We used transcranial direct current stimulation (TDCS), a method that can selectively inhibit or excitate neuronal populations by modulating GABAergic (anodal stimulation) and glutamatergic (cathodal stimulation) activity [5, 6]. We trained subjects for 6 days with artificial numerical symbols, during which we applied concurrent TDCS to the parietal lobes. The polarity of the brain stimulation specifically enhanced or impaired the acquisition of automatic number processing and the mapping of number into space, both important indices of numerical proficiency [7-9]. The improvement was still present 6 months after the training. Control tasks revealed that the effect of brain stimulation was specific to the representation of artificial numerical symbols. The specificity and longevity of TDCS on numerical abilities establishes TDCS as a realistic tool for intervention in cases of atypical numerical development or loss of numerical abilities because of stroke or degenerative illnesses."

Measuring contrast sensitivity changes after tDCS with a standard clinical tool such as threshold perimetry may provide an interesting perspective in assessing therapeutic effects of tDCS in ophthalmological or neurological defects (e.g. with foveal sparing vs. foveal splitting)."

Invasive procedures comprise peripheral nerve stimulation (particularly occipital nerve stimulation), vagus nerve stimulation, cervical spinal cord stimulation and hypothalamic deep brain stimulation. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial direct current stimulation are noninvasive variants. Based on current neuroimaging, neurophysiological and clinical studies occipital nerve stimulation and hypothalamic deep brain stimulation are recommended for patients with chronic cluster headache. Less convincing evidence can be found for their use in other refractory headaches such as chronic migraine. No clear recommendation can be given for the other neuromodulatory techniques. The emerging concept of intermittent stimulation of the sphenopalatine ganglion is nonetheless promising. Robust randomized and sham-controlled multicenter studies are needed before these therapeutic approaches are widely implemented. Due to the experimental nature all patients should be treated in clinical studies. It is essential to confirm the correct headache diagnosis and the refractory nature before an invasive approach is considered. Patients should generally be referred to specialized interdisciplinary outpatient departments which closely collaborate with neurosurgeons who are experienced in the implantation of neuromodulatory devices. It is crucial to ensure a competent postoperative follow-up with optimization of stimulation parameters and adjustment of medication."

Twenty rats died during the experimental course. The 41 rats that survived were allocated to the exercise group, the anodal stimulation group, the cathodal stimulation group, or the control group according to the initial motor function. Two-week treatment schedules started from 2 days postoperatively. Garcia, modified foot fault, and rota-rod performance scores were checked at 2, 9, and 16 days postoperatively. After the experiments, rats were sacrificed for the evaluation of histologic changes (changes of the white matter axon and infarct volume). The anodal stimulation and exercise groups showed improvement of Garcia's and modified foot fault scores at 16 days postoperatively. No significant change of the infarct volume happened after exercise and tDCS. Neuronal axons at the internal capsule of infarct hemispheres showed better preserved axons in the anodal stimulation group. From these results, repeated tDCS might have a neuroprotective effect on neuronal axons in rat stroke model."

To test this assumption, we probed the functional relevance of the left MC for learning of a novel action word vocabulary by disturbing neural plasticity in the MC with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). In combination with tDCS, subjects learned a novel vocabulary of 76 concrete, body-related actions by means of an associative learning paradigm. Compared with a control condition with ""sham"" stimulation, cathodal tDCS reduced success rates in vocabulary acquisition, as shown by tests of novel action word translation into the native language. The analysis of learning behavior revealed a specific effect of cathodal tDCS on the ability to associatively couple actions with novel words. In contrast, we did not find these effects in control experiments, when tDCS was applied to the prefrontal cortex or when subjects learned object-related words. The present study lends direct evidence to the proposition that the left MC is causally involved in the acquisition of novel action-related words."

Convergent methods from psychophysics, voxel-based morphometry, and diffusion tensor imaging with normal and tone-deaf (TD) subjects have shown that neural networks controlling pitch perception and production systems include bilateral frontotemporal networks. Although psychophysical and neuroimaging results are suggestive of a superior temporal and inferior frontal network responsible for pitch perception and production, active intervention of these areas is necessary to establish a causal connection between superior temporal and inferior frontal areas and pitch production ability. We sought to reverse-engineer the pitch perception-production network by noninvasive brain stimulation. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a noninvasive brain-stimulation technique that is optimal for auditory research, was applied over superior temporal and inferior frontal regions. Pitch matching ability was assessed using an individually optimized pitch matching task administered after each stimulation session. Results showed diminished accuracy in pitch matching after cathodal stimulation over inferior frontal and superior temporal areas compared to sham control. Results demonstrate that intact function and connectivity of a distributed cortical network, centered around bilateral superior temporal and inferior frontal regions, are required for efficient neural interactions with musical sounds."

In a sham controlled, double-blind, parallel group design, 39 patients were randomized into four groups receiving transcranial direct current stimulation with walking visual illusion or with control illusion and sham stimulation with visual illusion or with control illusion. For transcranial direct current stimulation, the anode was placed over the primary motor cortex. Each patient received ten treatment sessions during two consecutive weeks. Clinical assessment was performed before, after the last day of treatment, after 2 and 4 weeks follow-up and after 12 weeks. Clinical assessment included overall pain intensity perception, Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory and Brief Pain Inventory. The combination of transcranial direct current stimulation and visual illusion reduced the intensity of neuropathic pain significantly more than any of the single interventions. Patients receiving transcranial direct current stimulation and visual illusion experienced a significant improvement in all pain subtypes, while patients in the transcranial direct current stimulation group showed improvement in continuous and paroxysmal pain, and those in the visual illusion group improved only in continuous pain and dysaesthesias. At 12 weeks after treatment, the combined treatment group still presented significant improvement on the overall pain intensity perception, whereas no improvements were reported in the other three groups. Our results demonstrate that transcranial direct current stimulation and visual illusion can be effective in the management of neuropathic pain following spinal cord injury, with minimal side effects and with good tolerability."

Only participants who received left cathodal stimulation (decrease in excitability) together with right anodal stimulation (increase in excitability) showed an improvement in visual memory. This 110% improvement in visual memory was similar to the advantage people with autism, who are known to be more literal, show over normal people in the identical visual task. Importantly, participants receiving stimulation of the opposite polarity (left anodal together with right cathodal stimulation) failed to show any change in memory performance. This is the first demonstration that visual memory can be enhanced in healthy people using non-invasive brain stimulation."

Because of this, besides the implications for experimental neuroscientists, there is increasing interest in the potential for applying either method as a therapy in neurology, psychiatry, rehabilitation, and pain. Given that both techniques lead to the same final result, this article discusses in theory several issues that can help an investigator to decide whether rTMS or tDCS would be more suitable for the scope of the planned work."

Stimulation for few minutes has been shown to induce plastic alterations of cortical excitability and to improve cognitive performance. These effects might be caused by stimulation-induced alterations of functional cortical network connectivity. We aimed to investigate the impact of tDCS on cortical network function through functional connectivity and graph theoretical analysis. Single recordings in healthy volunteers with 62 electroencephalography channels were acquired before and after 10 min of facilitatory anodal tDCS over the primary motor cortex (M1), combined with inhibitory cathodal tDCS of the contralateral frontopolar cortex, in resting state and during voluntary hand movements. Correlation matrices containing all 62 pairwise electrode combinations were calculated with the synchronization likelihood (SL) method and thresholded to construct undirected graphs for the θ, α, β, low-γ and high-γ frequency bands. SL matrices and undirected graphs were compared before and after tDCS. Functional connectivity patterns significantly increased within premotor, motor, and sensorimotor areas of the stimulated hemisphere during motor activity in the 60-90 Hz frequency range. Additionally, tDCS-induced significant intrahemispheric and interhemispheric connectivity changes in all the studied frequency bands. In summary, we show for the first time evidence for tDCS-induced changes in brain synchronization and topological functional organization."

Here we address the validity of this appealing approach by investigating the effect of coupling a multisensory visual field exploration training with tDCS of the posterior parietal cortex (PPC). The multisensory visual field exploration training consisted in the practice of visual search through the systematic audio-visual stimulation of the visual field. Neurologically unimpaired participants performed a bimodal exploration training for 30 min, while simultaneously receiving anodal-excitatory PPC tDCS or sham tDCS. In two different experiments, the left and the right hemisphere were stimulated. Outcome measures included visual exploration speed at different time intervals during the training, and the post-training effects on tests assessing visual scanning and visuo-spatial orienting. Results show that PPC tDCS applied to the right, but not to the left, hemisphere increases the training-induced behavioural improvement of visual exploration, as compared to sham tDCS. In addition, right PPC tDCS brings about an improvement of covert visual orienting, in a task different from the visual search practice. In an additional experiment, we confirm that right parietal tDCS by itself, even without the associated training, can lead to enhancement of visual search. Overall, anodal PPC tDCS is a promising technique to enhance visuo-spatial abilities, when combined to a visual field exploration training task."
"A selective working memory impairment after transcranial direct current stimulation to the right parietal lobe.","Neuroscience letters",2010,312-6,479,Array,Array,20570713,3,"The role of the posterior parietal cortex in working memory (WM) is poorly understood. We previously found that patients with parietal lobe damage exhibited a selective WM impairment on recognition but not recall tasks. We hypothesized that this dissociation reflected strategic differences in the utilization of attention. One concern was that these findings, and our subsequent interpretation, would not generalize to normal populations because of the patients' older age, progressive disease processes, and/or possible brain reorganization following injury. To test whether our findings extended to a normal population we applied transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to right inferior parietal cortex. tDCS is a technique by which low electric current applied to the scalp modulates the resting potentials of underlying neural populations and can be used to test structure-function relationships. Eleven normal young adults received cathodal, anodal, or sham stimulation over right inferior posterior parietal cortex and then performed separate blocks of an object WM task probed by recall or recognition. The results showed that cathodal stimulation selectively impaired WM on recognition trials. These data replicate and extend our previous findings of preserved WM recall and impaired WM recognition in patients with parietal lobe lesions."

This is achieved by weak direct currents to shift the resting potential of cortical neurons. These currents are applied by attaching two electrodes (usually one anode and one cathode) to distinct areas of the skull. Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation (GVS) is a variant of tDCS where the electrodes are attached to the mastoids behind the ears in order to stimulate the vestibular system. tDCS and GVS are safe when standard procedures are used. We describe the basic physiological mechanisms and application of these procedures. We also review current data on the effects of tDCS and GVS in healthy subjects as well as clinical populations. Significant effects of such stimulation have been reported for motor, visual, somatosensory, attentional, vestibular and cognitive/emotional function as well as for a range of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Moreover, both techniques may induce neuroplastic changes which make them promising techniques in the field of neurorehabilitation. A number of open research questions that could be addressed with tDCS or GVS are formulated in the domains of sensory and motor processing, spatial and nonspatial attention including neglect, spatial cognition and body cognition disorders, as well as novel treatments for various neuropsychological disorders.

Based on split-brain and unilaterally damaged patients' performances, it has been proposed that the left hemisphere (LH) tends to match the frequencies, while the right hemisphere (RH) tends toward maximizing and always choosing the most frequent alternative. The current study used transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to test this hemispheric asymmetry hypothesis by stimulating the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of each hemisphere and simultaneously inhibiting the corresponding region in the homotopic hemisphere, while participants were engaged in a probabilistic guessing task. Results showed no difference in strategy between the three groups (RH anodal/LH cathodal, LH anodal/RH cathodal, no stimulation) as participants predominantly matched the frequencies of the two alternatives. However, when anodal tDCS was applied to the LH and cathodal tDCS applied to the RH, participants became quicker to select the most frequent alternative. This finding is in line with previous evidence on the involvement of the LH in probabilistic learning and reasoning and adds to a number of demonstrations of anodal tDCS leading to some behavioral enhancement or change in bias."

We used transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to modulate dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) function and to assess its influence on various types of lies. Twenty healthy volunteers were tested before and after tDCS (anodal and sham). In each session the Guilty Knowledge Task and Visual Attention Task were administered at baseline and immediately after tDCS ended. A computer-controlled task was used to evaluate truthful responses and lie responses to questions referring to personal information and general knowledge. Dependent variables collected were reaction times (RTs) and accuracy. At baseline the RTs were significantly longer for lies than for truthful responses. After sham stimulation, lie responses remained unchanged (p = 0.24) but after anodal tDCS, RTs decreased significantly only for lies involving general knowledge (p = 0.02). tDCS left the Visual Attention Task unaffected. These findings show that manipulating DLPFC function with tDCS specifically modulates deceptive responses for general information leaving those on personal information unaffected. Multiple cortical networks intervene in deception involving general and personal knowledge. Deception referring to general and personal knowledge probably involves multiple cortical networks."
"Effect of tDCS with an extracephalic reference electrode on cardio-respiratory and autonomic functions.","BMC neuroscience",2010,4241-5,11,Array,Array,20233439,,"Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is used in human physiological studies and for therapeutic trials in patients with abnormalities of cortical excitability. Its safety profile places tDCS in the pole-position for translating in real-world therapeutic application. However, an episode of transient respiratory depression in a subject receiving tDCS with an extracephalic electrode led to the suggestion that such an electrode montage could modulate the brainstem autonomic centres. We investigated whether tDCS applied over the midline frontal cortex in 30 healthy volunteers (sham n = 10, cathodal n = 10, anodal n = 10) with an extracephalic reference electrode would modulate brainstem activity as reflected by the monitoring and stringent analysis of vital parameters: heart rate (variability), respiratory rate, blood pressure and sympatho-vagal balance. We reasoned that this study could lead to two opposite but equally interesting outcomes: 1) If tDCS with an extracephalic electrode modulated vital parameters, it could be used as a new tool to explore the autonomic nervous system and, even, to modulate its activity for therapeutic purposes. 2) On the opposite, if applying tDCS with an extracephalic electrode had no effect, it could thus be used safely in healthy human subjects. This outcome would significantly impact the field of non-invasive brain stimulation with tDCS. Indeed, on the one hand, using an extracephalic electrode as a genuine neutral reference (as opposed to the classical ""bi-cephalic"" tDCS montages which deliver bi-polar stimulation of the brain) would help to comfort the conclusions of several modern studies regarding the spatial location and polarity of tDCS. On the other hand, using an extracephalic reference electrode may impact differently on a given cortical target due to the change of direct current flow direction; this may enlarge the potential interventions with tDCS."

Preliminary evidence indicates that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the temporo-parietal area might reduce tinnitus. tDCS studies of the prefrontal cortex have been successful in reducing depression, impulsiveness and pain. Recently, it was shown that the prefrontal cortex is important for the integration of sensory and emotional aspects of tinnitus. As such, frontal tDCS might suppress tinnitus as well. In an open label study, a total of 478 tinnitus patients received bilateral tDCS on dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (448 patients anode right, cathode left and 30 anode left, cathode right) for 20 min. Treatment effects were assessed with visual analogue scale for tinnitus intensity and distress. No tinnitus-suppressing effect was found for tDCS with left anode and right cathode. Analyses show that tDCS with right anode and left cathode modulates tinnitus perception in 29.9% of the tinnitus patients. For these responders a significant reduction was found for both tinnitus-related distress and tinnitus intensity. In addition, the amount of suppression for tinnitus-related distress is moderated by an interaction between tinnitus type and tinnitus laterality. This was, however, not the case for tinnitus intensity. Our study supports the involvement of the prefrontal cortex in the pathophysiology of tinnitus."

Cognitive neuroscience has now reached the point where it may begin to put theory derived from years of experimentation into practice. This special issue includes 16 articles that employ or examine a variety of neuroenhancement methods currently being developed to increase cognition in healthy people and in patients with neurological or psychiatric illness.

These methods can be used to improve attention, perception, memory and other forms of cognition in healthy individuals, leading to better performance in many aspects of everyday life. They may also reduce the cost, duration and overall impact of brain and mental illness in patients with neurological and psychiatric illness. Potential disadvantages of these techniques are also discussed. Given that the benefits of neuroenhancement outweigh the potential costs, these methods could potentially reduce suffering and improve quality of life for everyone, while further increasing our knowledge about the mechanisms of human cognition."

"Brain switches utilitarian behavior: does gender make the difference?","PloS one",2010,e8865,5,Array,Array,20111608,1,"Decision often implies a utilitarian choice based on personal gain, even at the expense of damaging others. Despite the social implications of utilitarian behavior, its neurophysiological bases remain largely unknown. To assess how the human brain controls utilitarian behavior, we delivered transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the ventral prefrontal cortex (VPC) and over the occipital cortex (OC) in 78 healthy subjects. Utilitarian judgment was assessed with the moral judgment task before and after tDCS. At baseline, females provided fewer utilitarian answers than males for personal moral dilemmas (p = .007). In males, VPC-tDCS failed to induce changes and in both genders OC-tDCS left utilitarian judgments unchanged. In females, cathodal VPC-tDCS tended to decrease whereas anodal VPC-tDCS significantly increased utilitarian responses (p = .005). In males and females, reaction times for utilitarian responses significantly decreased after cathodal (p<.001) but not after anodal (p = .735) VPC-tDCS. We conclude that ventral prefrontal tDCS interferes with utilitarian decisions, influencing the evaluation of the advantages and disadvantages of each option in both sexes, but does so more strongly in females. Whereas cathodal tDCS alters the time for utilitarian reasoning in both sexes, anodal stimulation interferes more incisively in women, modifying utilitarian reasoning and the possible consequent actions. The gender-related tDCS-induced changes suggest that the VPC differentially controls utilitarian reasoning in females and in males. The gender-specific functional organization of the brain areas involved in utilitarian behavior could be a correlate of the moral and social behavioral differences between the two sexes."

Currently, the duration of the aftereffects of stimulation is restricted. For future clinical applications, stimulation protocols are required that produce aftereffects lasting for days or weeks. Options to prolong the effects of tDCS are further prolongation or repetition of tDCS. Nothing is known thus far about optimal protocols in this behalf, although repetitive stimulation is already performed in clinical applications. Thus we explored the effects of different break durations on cathodal tDCS-induced cortical excitability alterations. In 12 subjects, two identical periods of cathodal tDCS (9-min duration; 1 mA) with an interstimulation interval of 0 (no break), 3, or 20 min or 3 or 24 h were performed. The results indicate that doubling stimulation duration without a break prolongs the aftereffects from 60 to 90 min after tDCS. When the second stimulation was performed during the aftereffects of the first, a prolongation and enhancement of tDCS-induced effects for ≤ 120 min after stimulation was observed. In contrast, when the second stimulation followed the first one after 3 or 24 h, the aftereffects were initially attenuated, or abolished, but afterwards re-established for up to 120 min after tDCS in the 24-h condition. These results suggest that, for prolonging the aftereffects of cathodal tDCS, stimulation interval might be important."

With tDCS, cortical neurons excitability increases in the vicinity of the anodal electrode and suppressed near the cathodal electrode. There is evidence that anorexia is associated with hyperactivity in right-hemisphere frontal regions. tDCS, therefore has a promising potential in facilitating inter-hemispheric balance. A tDCS protocol is proposed: the anode electrode placed over the left prefrontal cortex and the cathode electrode located, either on the right homotopic region for non-SSRI-medicated anorexics, or on a non-cephalic site for SSRI-medicated anorexics. Together with nutritional supplements, psychotherapy and other treatments, tDCS have a good potential, as a complementary tool, in the treatment of anorexia."

We identified five devices (transmeatal cochlear laser stimulation, transcranial micropolarization, transcranial electrostimulation, cranial electric stimulation and stimulation with weak electromagnetic fields) and compared them with two established NIBS devices (transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial direct current stimulation) and with well-known drugs used in neuropsychiatry (pramipexole and escitalopram) in order to understand the reasons why they failed to reach clinical practice and further steps of research development. Finally, we also discuss novel NIBS devices that have recently showed promising results: brain ultrasound and transcranial high-frequency random noise stimulation. Our results show that some of the reasons for the failure of NIBS devices with promising clinical findings are the difficulty to disseminate results, lack of controlled studies, duration of research development, mixed results and lack of standardization."

Several recent studies found an improvement of depressive symptoms in drug-free patients. Here we report the case of a 66-year-old female patient suffering from recurrent major depressive episodes who underwent anodal tDCS of the left dorsolateral PFC over 4 weeks as an add-on treatment to a stable antidepressant medication. Only a modest improvement of depressive symptoms was observed after tDCS, i.e. reduction of the baseline scores in the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale from 23 to 19 and in the Beck Depression Inventory from 27 to 20. However, there was an increase from 52 to 90% in the Regensburg Verbal Fluency Test. In addition, EEG was used to assess the acute effects of tDCS. Low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) showed a left unilateral focal effect (25-40% reduced power) in the delta, theta and alpha frequency bands. The same effect appeared in the surface analysis of the EEG. The absolute, as well as the relative power decreased significantly in the delta, theta and alpha bands after a comparison of the spectral analysis. Though tDCS over 4 weeks did not exert clinically meaningful antidepressant effects in this case of therapy-resistant depression, the findings for cognitive measures and EEG suggest that beneficial effects may occur in depressed subjects and future studies need to further explore this approach also in therapy-resistant major depression."

We determined if neuronal morphology predicted responses to subthreshold uniform electric fields. We characterized the effects of subthreshold electrical stimulation on identified cortical neurons in vitro. Uniform electric fields were applied to rat motor cortex brain slices, while recording from interneurons and pyramidal cells across cortical layers, using whole cell patch clamp. Neuron morphology was reconstructed following intracellular dialysis of biocytin. Based solely on volume-weighted morphology, we developed a simplified model of neuronal polarization by sub-threshold electric field: an electrotonically linear cylinder that further predicts polarization at distal dendritic tree terminations. We found that neuronal morphology correlated with somatic sub-threshold polarization. Layer V/VI pyramidal neuron somata (individually) and dendrites (averaging across neurons) were most sensitive to sub-threshold fields. This analysis was extended to predict a terminal polarization of a human cortical neuron as 1.44 mV during tDCS."

Previous neuroimaging studies demonstrated that Broca's area (left BA 44/45) is similarly activated by natural syntactic processing and artificial grammar learning. The current study was conducted to investigate the causal relationship between Broca's area and learning of an artificial grammar by means of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Thirty-eight healthy subjects participated in a between-subject design, with either anodal tDCS (20 min, 1 mA) or sham stimulation, over Broca's area during the acquisition of an artificial grammar. Performance during the acquisition phase, presented as a working memory task, was comparable between groups. In the subsequent classification task, detecting syntactic violations, and specifically, those where no cues to superficial similarity were available, improved significantly after anodal tDCS, resulting in an overall better performance. A control experiment where 10 subjects received anodal tDCS over an area unrelated to artificial grammar learning further supported the specificity of these effects to Broca's area. We conclude that Broca's area is specifically involved in rule-based knowledge, and here, in an improved ability to detect syntactic violations. The results cannot be explained by better tDCS-induced working memory performance during the acquisition phase. This is the first study that demonstrates that tDCS may facilitate acquisition of grammatical knowledge, a finding of potential interest for rehabilitation of aphasia."

Repeated drug administration induces neuroadaptations associated with abnormal dopaminergic activity in the mesocorticolimbic circuitry, resulting in altered cortical neurotransmission and excitability. Electrical stimulation of specific brain regions can be used in animal models and humans to induce local activation or disruption of specific circuitries or alter neuronal excitability and cause neuroadaptations. Non-surgical stimulation of specific brain regions in human addicts can be achieved by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). TMS is used for transient stimulation or disruption of neural activity in specific cortical regions, which can be used to assess cortical excitability, and to induce changes in cortical excitability. Moreover, it is suggested that repeated stimulation can cause long-lasting neuroadaptations. Therefore, TMS paradigms were used in some studies to assess the presence of altered cortical excitability associated with chronic drug consumption, while other studies have begun to assess the therapeutic potential of repetitive TMS. Similarly, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is used to modulate neuronal resting membrane potential in humans and alter cortical excitability. The current review describes how these brain stimulation techniques have recently been used for the study and treatment of addiction in animal models and humans."

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)-guided transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was applied to the frontal eye fields (FEFs) and intraparietal sulcus (IPS). A single pulse was delivered 60, 30, or 0 ms before a discrimination target was presented at, or next to, the target of a saccade in preparation. Results showed that the known enhancement of discrimination performance specific to locations to which eye movements are being prepared was enhanced by early TMS on the FEF contralateral to eye movement direction, whereas TMS on the IPS resulted in a general performance increase. The current findings indicate that the FEF affects selective visual processing within the visual cortex itself through direct feedback projections."

The impact of this cortical modulation on spinal cord network excitability has rarely been studied. In this series of experiments, performed in healthy subjects, we show that anodal tDCS increases disynaptic inhibition directed from extensor carpi radialis (ECR) to flexor carpi radialis (FCR) with no modification of presynaptic inhibition of FCR Ia terminals and FCR H-reflex recruitment curves. We also show that cathodal tDCS does not modify spinal network excitability. Our results suggest that the increase of disynaptic inhibition observed during anodal tDCS relies on an increase of disynaptic interneuron excitability and that tDCS over the motor cortex in human subjects induces effects on spinal network excitability. Our results highlight the fact that the effects of tDCS should be considered in regard to spinal motor circuits and not only to cortical circuits."

The purpose of this paper is to review information on the use of TMS and tDCS as research tools to facilitate motor memory formation, motor performance and motor learning in healthy volunteers. Studies implemented so far have mostly focused on the ability of TMS and tDCS to elicit relatively short lasting motor improvements and the mechanisms underlying these changes have been only partially investigated. Despite limitations including the scarcity of data, work that has been already accomplished raises the exciting hypothesis that currently available noninvasive transcranial stimulation techniques could modulate motor learning and memory formation in healthy humans and potentially in patients with neurological and psychiatric disorders."
"Boosting cortical activity at Beta-band frequencies slows movement in humans.","Current biology : CB",2009,3469-80,19,Array,Array,19095754,19,"Neurons have a striking tendency to engage in oscillatory activities. One important type of oscillatory activity prevalent in the motor system occurs in the beta frequency band, at about 20 Hz. It is manifest during the maintenance of tonic contractions and is suppressed prior to and during voluntary movement. This and other correlative evidence suggests that beta activity might promote tonic contraction, while impairing motor processing related to new movements. Hence, bursts of beta activity in the cortex are associated with a strengthening of the motor effects of sensory feedback during tonic contraction and with reductions in the velocity of voluntary movements. Moreover, beta activity is increased when movement has to be resisted or voluntarily suppressed. Here we use imperceptible transcranial alternating-current stimulation to entrain cortical activity at 20 Hz in healthy subjects and show that this slows voluntary movement. The present findings are the first direct evidence of causality between any physiological oscillatory brain activity and concurrent motor behavior in the healthy human and help explain how the exaggerated beta activity found in Parkinson's disease can lead to motor slowing in this illness."

However, local and distant effects of tDCS on motor-related cortical activation patterns remain poorly defined, limiting the rationale for its use. Here we describe the results of a functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) experiment designed to characterize local and distant effects on cortical motor activity following excitatory anodal stimulation and inhibitory cathodal stimulation. Fifteen right-handed subjects performed a visually cued serial reaction time task with their right hand in a 3-T MRI scanner both before and after 10 min of 1-mA tDCS applied to the left primary motor cortex (M1). Relative to sham stimulation, anodal tDCS led to short-lived activation increases in the M1 and the supplementary motor area (SMA) within the stimulated hemisphere. The increase in activation in the SMA with anodal stimulation was found also when directly comparing anodal with cathodal stimulation. Relative to sham stimulation, cathodal tDCS led to an increase in activation in the contralateral M1 and dorsal premotor cortex (PMd), as well as an increase in functional connectivity between these areas and the stimulated left M1. These increases were also found when directly comparing cathodal with anodal stimulation. Significant within-session linear decreases in activation occurred in all scan sessions. The after-effects of anodal tDCS arose primarily from a change in the slope of these decreases. In addition, following sham stimulation compared with baseline, a between-session decrease in task-related activity was found. The effects of cathodal tDCS arose primarily from a reduction of this normal decrease."

Yet, there is still little knowledge on how time-varied exogenous currents acutely modulate cortical excitability. In ten healthy individuals we used on-line single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to search for systematic shifts in corticospinal excitability during anodal sleeplike 0.8-Hz slow oscillatory transcranial direct current stimulation (so-tDCS). In separate sessions, we repeatedly applied 30-s trials (two blocks at 20 min) of either anodal so-tDCS or constant tDCS (c-tDCS) to the primary motor hand area during quiet wakefulness. Simultaneously and time-locked to different phase angles of the slow oscillation, motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) as an index of corticospinal excitability were obtained in the contralateral hand muscles 10, 20, and 30 s after the onset of tDCS. MEPs were also measured off-line before, between, and after both stimulation blocks to detect any lasting excitability shifts. Both tDCS modes increased MEP amplitudes during stimulation with an attenuation of the facilitatory effect toward the end of a 30-s tDCS trial. No phase-locking of corticospinal excitability to the exogenous oscillation was observed during so-tDCS. Off-line TMS revealed that both c-tDCS and so-tDCS resulted in a lasting excitability increase. The individual magnitude of MEP facilitation during the first tDCS trials predicted the lasting MEP facilitation found after tDCS. We conclude that sleep slow oscillation-like excitability changes cannot be actively imposed on the awake cortex with so-tDCS, but phase-independent on-line as well as off-line facilitation can reliably be induced."

Craving is one of the main reasons subjects continue to smoke; therefore interventions that can modify activity in neural networks associated with craving can be useful tools in future research investigating novel treatments for smoking cessation. The goal of this study was to use a neuromodulatory technique associated with a powerful effect on spontaneous neuronal firing - transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) - to modify cue-provoked smoking craving. Based on preliminary data showing that craving can be modified after a single tDCS session, here we investigated the effects of repeated tDCS sessions on craving behavior. Twenty-seven subjects were randomized to receive sham or active tDCS (anodal tDCS of the left DLPFC). Our results show a significant cumulative effect of tDCS on modifying smoking cue-provoked craving. In fact, in the group of active stimulation, smoking cues had an opposite effect on craving after stimulation - it decreased craving - as compared to sham stimulation in which there was a small decrease or increase on craving. In addition, during these 5 days of stimulation there was a small but significant decrease in the number of cigarettes smoked in the active as compared to sham tDCS group. Our findings extend the results of our previous study as they confirm the notion that tDCS has a specific effect on craving behavior and that the effects of several sessions can increase the magnitude of its effect. These results open avenues for the exploration of this method as a therapeutic alternative for smoking cessation and also as a mean to change stimulus-induced behavior."

Noninvasive stimulation of the cerebellum results in neurophysiological and behavioral changes, an effect that has been attributed to modulation of cerebello-brain connectivity. At rest, the cerebellum exerts an overall inhibitory tone over the primary motor cortex (M1), cerebello-brain inhibition (CBI), likely through dentate-thalamo-cortical connections. The level of excitability of this pathway before and after stimulation of the cerebellum, however, has not been directly investigated. In this study, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation to determine changes in M1, brainstem, and CBI before and after 25 min of anodal, cathodal, or sham transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) applied over the right cerebellar cortex. We hypothesized that anodal tDCS would result in an enhancement of CBI and cathodal would decrease it, relative to sham stimulation. We found that cathodal tDCS resulted in a clear decrease of CBI, whereas anodal tDCS increased it, in the absence of changes after sham stimulation. These effects were specific to the cerebello-cortical connections with no changes in other M1 or brainstem excitability measures. The cathodal effect on CBI was found to be dependent on stimulation intensity and lasted up to 30 min after the cessation of tDCS. These results suggest that tDCS can modulate in a focal and polarity-specific manner cerebellar excitability, likely through changes in Purkinje cell activity. Therefore, direct current stimulation of the cerebellum may have significant potential implications for patients with cerebellar dysfunction as well as to motor control studies."

We applied anodal, cathoP:dal or sham transcranial direct current stimulation (57 microA/cm(2), 10 min) to the left or right posterior parietal cortex. Using a visual detection task in a group of right-handed healthy individuals (n = 20), we observed that transcranial direct current stimulation enhanced or impaired performance depending on stimulation parameters (i.e. current polarity) and stimulated hemisphere. These results are in good accordance with classic models of reciprocal interhemispheric competition ('rivalry'). In a second experiment, we investigated the potential of transcranial direct current stimulation to ameliorate left visuospatial neglect (n = 10). Interestingly, both the inhibitory effect of cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation applied over the unlesioned posterior parietal cortex and the facilitatory effect of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation applied over the lesioned posterior parietal cortex reduced symptoms of visuospatial neglect. Taken together, our findings suggest that transcranial direct current stimulation applied over the posterior parietal cortex can be used to modulate visuospatial processing and that this effect is exerted by influencing interhemispheric reciprocal networks.

We also compare the effects of non-invasive central nervous system stimulation with techniques of non-invasive peripheral electrical stimulation, in order to provide new insights for future developments.

"Treatment of depression with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS): a review.","Experimental neurology",2009,305-11,219,Array,Array,19348793,1,"Major Depression Disorder (MDD) is usually accompanied by alterations of cortical activity and excitability, especially in prefrontal areas. These are reflections of a dysfunction in a distributed cortico-subcortical, bihemispheric network. Therefore it is reasonable to hypothesize that altering this pathological state with techniques of brain stimulation may offer a therapeutic target. Besides repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, tonic stimulation with weak direct currents (tDCS) modulates cortical excitability for hours after the end of stimulation, thus, it is a promising non-invasive therapeutic option. Early studies from the 1960s suggested some efficacy of DC stimulation to reduce symptoms in depression, but mixed results and development of psychotropic drugs resulted in an early abandonment of this technique. In the last years tDCS protocols have been optimized. Application of the newly developed stimulation protocols in patients with major depression has shown promise in few pilot studies.

The neurophysiological basis for these effects might be a focusing effect of dopamine on neuroplasticity: Accordingly, in humans L-dopa prolongs focal facilitatory plasticity, but turns nonfocal facilitatory plasticity into inhibition. Here we explore the impact of D(1) receptors on plasticity. Nonfocal plasticity was induced by transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), and focal plasticity by paired associative stimulation (PAS). Subjects received sulpiride, a D(2) antagonist, to increase the relative contribution of D(1) receptors to dopaminergic activity, combined sulpiride and L-dopa, to increase the relation of D(1)/D(2) activity further, or placebo medication. Under placebo, anodal tDCS and excitatory PAS (ePAS) increased motor cortex excitability. Cathodal tDCS and inhibitory PAS (iPAS) reduced it. Sulpiride abolished iPAS-induced inhibition, but not ePAS-generated facilitation, underlining the importance of D(1)-receptor activity for focal facilitatory neuroplasticity. Combining sulpiride with L-dopa reestablished iPAS-induced inhibition, but did not affect ePAS-induced plasticity. tDCS-induced plasticity, which was abolished by sulpiride in a former study, also recovered. Thus enhancing D(1) activity further relative to D(2) activity is relevant for facilitatory and inhibitory plasticity. However, comparison with former results show that an appropriate balance of D(1) and D(2) activity seems necessary to (1) consolidate the respective excitability modifications and (2) to elicit a focusing effect."

In the present study we combined TMS with concurrent electroencephalography (EEG) in order to obtain direct cortical correlates of SAI. TMS-evoked EEG responses and MEPs were analysed with and without preceding electrical stimulation of the index finger cutaneous afferents in ten healthy volunteers. We show that the attenuation of MEPs by cutaneous stimulation has its counterpart in the attenuation of the N100 EEG response. Moreover, the attenuation of the cortical N100 component correlated positively with the strength of SAI, indicating that the transient changes in cortical excitability can be reflected in the amplitude dynamics of MEPs. We hypothesize that the hyperpolarization of the pyramidal cells due to SAI lowers the capacity of TMS to induce the inhibitory current needed to elicit N100, thus leading to its attenuation. We suggest that the observed interaction of two inhibitory processes, SAI and N100, provides further evidence for the cortical origin of SAI."

Neurophysiological techniques like evoked potentials (EP) and in the last years non-invasive brain stimulation techniques like transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation gave important contribution to understanding of such issue highlighting possible mechanisms of cortical dysfunctions in migraine. EP studies showed impaired habituation to repeated sensorial stimulation and this abnormality was confirmed across all sensorial modalities, making defective habituation a neurophysiological hallmark of the disease. TMS was employed to test more directly cortical excitability in visual cortex and then also in motor cortex. Contradictory results have been reported pointing towards hyperexcitability or on the contrary to reduced preactivation of sensory cortex in migraine. Other experimental evidence speaks in favour of impairment of inhibitory circuits and analogies have been proposed between migraine and conditions of sensory deafferentation in which down-regulation of GABA circuits is considered the more relevant pathophysiological mechanism. Whatever the mechanism involved, it has been found that repeated sessions of high-frequency rTMS trains that have been shown to up-regulate inhibitory circuits could persistently normalize habituation in migraine. This could give interesting insight into pathophysiology establishing a link between cortical inhibition and habituation and opening also new treatment strategies in migraine."

"[Transcranial direct current stimulation--a new tool for human cognitive neuroscience].","Brain and nerve = Shinkei kenkyū no shinpo",2009,191-208,61,Array,Array,9708543,1,"Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive procedure of cortical stimulation, in which weak direct currents are used to polarize target brain regions. Depending on the polarity of the stimulation, tDCS can increase (anodal tDCS) or decrease (cathodal tDCS) cortical excitability in the stimulated brain regions and thereby enable the investigation of the causal relationships between brain activity and behavior. Recently, tDCS has been increasingly used to investigate human cognitive and motor functions in both healthy volunteers and neurological patients. Although tDCS generally produces diffuse cortical stimulation over a period of time, it has several advantages over other brain-stimulation tools such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). First, since tDCS produces less artifacts such as acoustic noise and muscle twitching, it is more suitable for double-blind, sham-controlled studies and clinical applications. Second, tDCS is not very expensive and can be performed with compact equipment, it can be easily combined with ongoing projects in neuroscience and psychology laboratories. Third, the facilitation of motor and cognitive functions by anodal tDCS may have great potential for cognitive and motor enhancement, for example, to support learning in healthy volunteers and to expedite the rehabilitation process in neurological patients. Finally, thus far, seizure incidents have not been reported in tDCS studies, tDCS has thus become a complementary tool to TMS and occupies a unique position in current cognitive neuroscience."
"Noninvasive cortical stimulation enhances motor skill acquisition over multiple days through an effect on consolidation.","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America",2009,191-208,106,Array,Array,2215917,5,"Motor skills can take weeks to months to acquire and can diminish over time in the absence of continued practice. Thus, strategies that enhance skill acquisition or retention are of great scientific and practical interest. Here we investigated the effect of noninvasive cortical stimulation on the extended time course of learning a novel and challenging motor skill task. A skill measure was chosen to reflect shifts in the task's speed-accuracy tradeoff function (SAF), which prevented us from falsely interpreting variations in position along an unchanged SAF as a change in skill. Subjects practiced over 5 consecutive days while receiving transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the primary motor cortex (M1). Using the skill measure, we assessed the impact of anodal (relative to sham) tDCS on both within-day (online) and between-day (offline) effects and on the rate of forgetting during a 3-month follow-up (long-term retention). There was greater total (online plus offline) skill acquisition with anodal tDCS compared to sham, which was mediated through a selective enhancement of offline effects. Anodal tDCS did not change the rate of forgetting relative to sham across the 3-month follow-up period, and consequently the skill measure remained greater with anodal tDCS at 3 months. This prolonged enhancement may hold promise for the rehabilitation of brain injury. Furthermore, these findings support the existence of a consolidation mechanism, susceptible to anodal tDCS, which contributes to offline effects but not to online effects or long-term retention."

Furthermore, TMS and tDCS can be applied with other techniques, such as event-related potentials and pharmacologic manipulation, to illuminate the underlying physiologic mechanisms of normal and pathological pain. This review presents a description and overview of the uses of two major brain stimulation techniques and a listing of useful references for further study."
"The potential role of brain stimulation in the management of postoperative pain.","Journal of pain management",2009,191-208,2,Array,Array,18034687,3,"There is limited evidence to date of the effectiveness of minimally-invasive brain stimulation in controlling postoperative pain. Two studies have provided preliminary evidence that transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can significantly reduce post-operative pain, and no studies have been published on the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on postoperative pain. The evidence supporting the role of brain stimulation in producing general anesthetic effects is also limited but there is a possibility that appropriately targeted electrical stimulation might have a role in the future if the technology permits such stimulation in a non-invasive manner. The present article provides a brief overview of the available evidence supporting the role of minimally invasive brain stimulation technology in perioperative medicine. More studies and well-controlled trials are needed to establish a clear role for minimally-invasive brain stimulation technologies in the perioperative arena."
"Non-invasive brain stimulation approaches to fibromyalgia pain.","Journal of pain management",2009,191-208,2,Array,Array,18279433,3,"Fibromyalgia is a poorly understood disorder that likely involves central nervous system sensory hypersensitivity. There are a host of genetic, neuroendocrine and environmental abnormalities associated with the disease, and recent research findings suggest enhanced sensory processing, and abnormalities in central monoamines and cytokines expression in patients with fibromyalgia. The morbidity and financial costs associated with fibromyalgia are quite high despite conventional treatments with antidepressants, anticonvulsants, low-impact aerobic exercise and psychotherapy. Noninvasive brain stimulation techniques, such as transcranial direct current stimulation, transcranial magnetic stimulation, and electroconvulsive therapy are beginning to be studied as possible treatments for fibromyalgia pain. Early studies appear promising but more work is needed. Future directions in clinical care may include innovative combinations of noninvasive brain stimulation, pharmacological augmentation, and behavior therapies."
"Efficacy of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) for the treatment of fibromyalgia: results of a randomized, sham-controlled longitudinal clinical trial.","Journal of pain management",2009,353-361,2,Array,Array,21170277,3,"Fibromyalgia has been recognized as a central pain disorder with evidence of neuroanatomic and neurophysiologic alterations. Previous studies with techniques of noninvasive brain stimulation--transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)--have shown that these methods are associated with a significant alleviation of fibromyalgia-associated pain and sleep dysfunction. Here we sought to determine whether a longer treatment protocol involving 10 sessions of 2 mA, 20 min tDCS of the left primary motor (M1) or dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) could offer additional, more long-lasting clinical benefits in the management of pain from fibromyalgia. METHODS: Forty-one women with chronic, medically refractory fibromyalgia were randomized to receive 10 daily sessions of M1, DLPFC, or sham tDCS. RESULTS: Our results show that M1 and DLPFC stimulation both display improvements in pain scores (VAS) and quality of life (FIQ) at the end of the treatment protocol, but only M1 stimulation resulted in long-lasting clinical benefits as assessed at 30 and 60 days after the end of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the importance of the duration of the treatment period, suggesting that 10 daily sessions of tDCS result in more long lasting outcomes than only five sessions. Furthermore, this study supports the findings of a similarly designed rTMS trial as both induce pain reductions that are equally long-lasting."

"Controversy: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation or transcranial direct current stimulation shows efficacy in treating psychiatric diseases (depression, mania, schizophrenia, obsessive-complusive disorder, panic, posttraumatic stress disorder).","Brain stimulation",2009,353-361,2,Array,Array,20633399,1,"Brain imaging studies performed over the past 20 years have generated new knowledge about the specific brain regions involved in the brain diseases that have been classically labeled as psychiatric. These include the mood and anxiety disorders, and the schizophrenias. As a natural next step, clinical researchers have investigated whether the minimally invasive brain stimulation technologies (transcranial magnetic stimulation [TMS] or transcranial direct current stimulation [tDCS]) might potentially treat these disorders. In this review, we critically review the research studies that have examined TMS or tDCS as putative treatments for depression, mania, obsessive-complusive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, panic disorder, or schizophrenia. (Separate controversy articles deal with using TMS or tDCS to treat pain or tinnitus. We will not review here the large number of studies using TMS or tDCS as research probes to understand disease mechanisms of psychiatric disorders.) Although there is an extensive body of randomized controlled trials showing antidepressant effects of daily prefrontal repetitive TMS, the magnitude or durability of this effect remains controversial. US Food and Drug Administration approval of TMS for depression was recently granted. There is much less data in all other diseases, and therapeutic effects in other psychiatric conditions, if any, are still controversial. Several issues and problems extend across all psychiatric TMS studies, including the optimal method for a sham control, appropriate coil location, best device parameters (intensity, frequency, dosage, and dosing schedule) and refining what subjects should be doing during treatment (activating pathologic circuits or not). In general, TMS or tDCS as a treatment for most psychiatric disorders remains exciting but controversial, other than prefrontal TMS for depression."
"Increasing human brain excitability by transcranial high-frequency random noise stimulation.","The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience",2008,353-361,28,Array,Array,19109497,52,"For >20 years, noninvasive transcranial stimulation techniques like repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and direct current stimulation (tDCS) have been used to induce neuroplastic-like effects in the human cortex, leading to the activity-dependent modification of synaptic transmission. Here, we introduce a novel method of electrical stimulation: transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS), whereby a random electrical oscillation spectrum is applied over the motor cortex. tRNS induces consistent excitability increases lasting 60 min after stimulation. These effects have been observed in 80 subjects through both physiological measures and behavioral tasks. Higher frequencies (100-640 Hz) appear to be responsible for generating this excitability increase, an effect that may be attributed to the repeated opening of Na(+) channels. In terms of efficacy tRNS appears to possess at least the same therapeutic potential as rTMS/tDCS in diseases such as depression, while furthermore avoiding the constraint of current flow direction sensitivity characteristic of tDCS."

"Modulating activity in the motor cortex affects performance for the two hands differently depending upon which hemisphere is stimulated.","The European journal of neuroscience",2008,444-7,28,Array,Array,18973584,8,"We modulated neural excitability in the human motor cortex to investigate behavioral effects for both hands. In a previous study, we showed that decreasing excitability in the dominant motor cortex led to a decline in performance for the contralateral hand and an improvement for the ipsilateral hand; increasing excitability produced the opposite effects. Research suggests that the ipsilateral effects were mediated by interhemispheric inhibition. Physiological evidence points to an asymmetry in interhemispheric inhibition between the primary motor cortices, with stronger inhibitory projections coming from the dominant motor cortex. In the present study, we examined whether there is a hemispheric asymmetry in the effects on performance when modulating excitability in the motor cortex. Anodal and cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation were applied to the motor cortex of 17 participants, targeting the non-dominant hemisphere on one day and the dominant hemisphere on another day, along with one sham session. Participants performed a finger-sequence coordination task with each hand before and after stimulation. The dependent variable was calculated as the percentage of change in the number of correct keystrokes. We found that the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation depended upon which hemisphere was stimulated; modulating excitability in the dominant motor cortex significantly affected performance for the contralateral and ipsilateral hands, whereas modulating excitability in the non-dominant motor cortex only had a significant impact for the contralateral hand. These results provide evidence for a hemispheric asymmetry in the ipsilateral effects of modulating excitability in the motor cortex and may be important for clinical research on motor recovery."
"Dual-hemisphere tDCS facilitates greater improvements for healthy subjects' non-dominant hand compared to uni-hemisphere stimulation.","BMC neuroscience",2008,444-7,9,Array,Array,18957075,,"Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive technique that has been found to modulate the excitability of neurons in the brain. The polarity of the current applied to the scalp determines the effects of tDCS on the underlying tissue: anodal tDCS increases excitability, whereas cathodal tDCS decreases excitability. Research has shown that applying anodal tDCS to the non-dominant motor cortex can improve motor performance for the non-dominant hand, presumably by means of changes in synaptic plasticity between neurons. Our previous studies also suggest that applying cathodal tDCS over the dominant motor cortex can improve performance for the non-dominant hand; this effect may result from modulating inhibitory projections (interhemispheric inhibition) between the motor cortices of the two hemispheres. We hypothesized that stimultaneously applying cathodal tDCS over the dominant motor cortex and anodal tDCS over the non-dominant motor cortex would have a greater effect on finger sequence performance for the non-dominant hand, compared to stimulating only the non-dominant motor cortex. Sixteen right-handed participants underwent three stimulation conditions: 1) dual-hemisphere - with anodal tDCS over the non-dominant motor cortex, and cathodal tDCS over the dominant motor cortex, 2) uni-hemisphere - with anodal tDCS over the non-dominant motor cortex, and 3) sham tDCS. Participants performed a finger-sequencing task with the non-dominant hand before and after each stimulation. The dependent variable was the percentage of change in performance, comparing pre- and post-tDCS scores."

Here we aimed to explore further this matter and investigate whether the effects of tDCS applied over the superior temporal cortex differs between males and females during a facial expression go-no-go task. Fourteen healthy subjects were exposed to a facial expression go-no-go task while they received two different conditions of stimulation: anodal tDCS of the left temporal cortex (with cathodal stimulation of the right temporal cortex) and sham tDCS. The order of conditions was randomized and counterbalanced across subjects. During each stimulation session (after 5 min of stimulation), subjects underwent a go-no-go task. The results showed that women had significantly more correct answers when compared to men (p=0.03) that was independent of condition of stimulation and valence of figures. In addition, women made significantly less errors during temporal stimulation when compared to sham stimulation (p=0.009) when responding to sad faces. Similarly, men made significantly more errors during temporal active stimulation as compared with sham stimulation (p=0.004) when responding to sad faces. Our results confirmed the notion that performance to facial expression recognition is increased in females compared with males and that modulation of temporal cortex with tDCS leads to differential effects according to gender."
"TMS evidence for smooth pursuit gain control by the frontal eye fields.","Cerebral cortex (New York, N.Y. : 1991)",2009,444-7,19,Array,Array,19064743,5,"The remote associates test (RAT) is a complex verbal task with associations to both creative thought and general intelligence. RAT problems require not only lateral associations and the internal production of many words but a convergent focus on a single answer. Complex problem-solving of this sort may thus require both substantial verbal processing and strong executive function capacities. Previous studies have provided evidence that verbal task performance can be enhanced by noninvasive transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). tDCS modulates excitability of neural tissue depending on the polarity of the current. The after-effects of this modulation may have effects on task performance if the task examined draws on the modulated region. Studies of verbal cognition have focused largely on the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (F3 of the 10-20 EEG system) as a region of interest. We planned to assess whether modulating excitability at F3 could affect complex verbal abilities. In Experiment 1 (anodal, cathodal, or sham stimulation over F3 with the reference electrode over the contralateral supraorbital region), we found a significant overall effect of stimulation condition on RAT performance. Post hoc tests showed an increase in performance after anodal stimulation (1 mA) compared to sham (p = .025) and to cathodal stimulation (p = .038). In Experiment 2 (either anodal stimulation at F3 or separately at its homologue F4), we replicated the anodal effect of the first study, but also showed that anodal stimulation of F4 had no effect on RAT performance. These data provide evidence that anodal stimulation of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex can improve performance on a complex verbal problem-solving task believed to require significant executive function capacity."
"Modulatory effects of transcranial direct current stimulation on laser-evoked potentials.","Pain medicine (Malden, Mass.)",2009,444-7,10,Array,Array,12244081,1,"The brain-derived neurotrophic factor gene (BDNF) is one of many genes thought to influence synaptic plasticity in the adult brain and shows a common single nucleotide polymorphism (BDNF Val66Met) in the normal population that is associated with differences in hippocampal volume and episodic memory. It is also thought to influence possible synaptic changes in motor cortex following a simple motor learning task. Here we extend these studies by using new non-invasive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (TDCS) techniques that directly test the excitability and plasticity of neuronal circuits in human motor cortex in subjects at rest. We investigated whether the susceptibility to TMS probes of plasticity is significantly influenced by the BDNF polymorphism. Val66Met carriers were matched with Val66Val individuals and tested on the following protocols: continuous and intermittent theta burst TMS; median nerve paired associative stimulation; and homeostatic plasticity in the TDCS/1 Hz rTMS model. The response of Met allele carriers differed significantly in all protocols compared with the response of Val66Val individuals. We suggest that this is due to the effect of BNDF on the susceptibility of synapses to undergo LTP/LTD. The circuits tested here are implicated in the pathophysiology of movement disorders such as dystonia and are being assessed as potential new targets in the treatment of stroke. Thus the polymorphism may be one factor that influences the natural response of the brain to injury and disease."
"Skin lesions after treatment with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS).","Brain stimulation",2008,444-7,1,Array,Array,12803972,4,"Smooth pursuit eye movements are used to continuously track slowly moving visual objects. A peculiar property of the smooth pursuit system is the nonlinear increase in sensitivity to changes in target motion with increasing pursuit velocities. We investigated the role of the frontal eye fields (FEFs) in this dynamic gain control mechanism by application of transcranial magnetic stimulation. Subjects were required to pursue a slowly moving visual target whose motion consisted of 2 components: a constant velocity component at 4 different velocities (0, 8, 16, and 24 deg/s) and a superimposed high-frequency sinusoidal oscillation (4 Hz, +/-8 deg/s). Magnetic stimulation of the FEFs reduced not only the overall gain of the system, but also the efficacy of the dynamic gain control. We thus provide the first direct evidence that the FEF population is significantly involved in the nonlinear computation necessary for continuously adjusting the feedforward gain of the pursuit system. We discuss this with relation to current models of smooth pursuit."
"Controversy: Noninvasive and invasive cortical stimulation show efficacy in treating stroke patients.","Brain stimulation",2008,370-82,1,Array,Array,20633395,4,"Stroke is the leading cause of disability in the adult population of western industrialized countries. Despite significant improvements of acute stroke care, two thirds of stroke survivors have to cope with persisting neurologic deficits. Adjuvant brain stimulation is a novel approach to improving the treatment of residual deficits after stroke. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), and epidural electrical stimulation have been used in first trials on small cohorts of stroke patients. Effect sizes in the order of 8% to 30% of functional improvement have been reported, but a publication bias toward presenting ""promising"" but not negative results is likely. Many questions regarding underlying mechanisms, optimal stimulation parameters, combination with other types of interventions, among others, are open. This review addresses six controversies related to the experimental application of brain stimulation techniques to stroke patients. Cortical stimulation after stroke will need to be individually tailored and a thorough patient stratification according to type and extent of clinical deficit, lesion location, lesion size, comorbidities, time in the recovery process, and perhaps also age and gender will be necessary. There is consensus that cortical stimulation in stroke patients is still experimental and should only be applied in the frame of scientific studies."
"Consensus: Can transcranial direct current stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation enhance motor learning and memory formation?","Brain stimulation",2008,370-82,1,Array,Array,20633394,4,"Noninvasive brain stimulation has developed as a promising tool for cognitive neuroscientists.

The purpose of this article is to review information on the use of TMS and tDCS as research tools to facilitate motor memory formation, motor performance, and motor learning in healthy volunteers. Studies implemented so far have mostly focused on the ability of TMS and tDCS to elicit relatively short-lasting motor improvements and the mechanisms underlying these changes have been only partially investigated. Despite limitations, including the scarcity of data, work that has been already accomplished raises the exciting hypothesis that currently available noninvasive transcranial stimulation techniques could modulate motor learning and memory formation in healthy humans and potentially in patients with neurologic and psychiatric disorders."
"The use of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to relieve pain.","Brain stimulation",2008,370-82,1,Array,Array,20633392,4,"Chronic pain resulting from injury of the peripheral or central nervous system may be associated with a significant dysfunction of extensive neural networks. Noninvasive stimulation techniques, such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) may be suitable to treat chronic pain as they can act on these networks by modulating neural activities not only in the stimulated area, but also in remote regions that are interconnected to the site of stimulation. Motor cortex was the first cortical target that was proved to be efficacious in chronic pain treatment. At present, significant analgesic effects were also shown to occur after the stimulation of other cortical targets (including prefrontal and parietal areas) in acute provoked pain, chronic neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, or visceral pain. Therapeutic applications of rTMS in pain syndromes are limited by the short duration of the induced effects, but prolonged pain relief can be obtained by repeating rTMS sessions every day for several weeks. Recent tDCS studies also showed some effects on various types of chronic pain. We review the evidence to date of these two techniques of noninvasive brain stimulation for the treatment of pain."
"Efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation/transcranial direct current stimulation in cognitive neurorehabilitation.","Brain stimulation",2008,370-82,1,Array,Array,20633391,4,"Cognitive deficits are a common consequence of neurologic disease, in particular, of traumatic brain injury, stroke, and neurodegenerative disorders, and there is evidence that specific cognitive training may be effective in cognitive rehabilitation. Several investigations emphasize the fact that interacting with cortical activity, by means of cortical stimulation, can positively affect the short-term cognitive performance and improve the rehabilitation potential of neurologic patients. In this respect, preliminary evidence suggests that cortical stimulation may play a role in treating aphasia, unilateral neglect, and other cognitive disorders. Several possible mechanisms can account for the effects of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on cognitive performance. They all reflect the potential of these methods to improve the subject's ability to relearn or to acquire new strategies for carrying out behavioral tasks. The responsible mechanisms remain unclear but they are most likely related to the activation of impeded pathways or inhibition of maladaptive responses. Modifications of the brain activity may assist relearning by facilitating local activity or by suppressing interfering activity from other brain areas. Notwithstanding the promise of these preliminary findings, to date no systematic application of these methods to neurorehabilitation research has been reported. Considering the potential benefit of these interventions, further studies taking into consideration large patient populations, long treatment periods, or the combination of different rehabilitation strategies are needed. Brain stimulation is indeed an exciting opportunity in the field of cognitive neurorehabilitation, which is clearly in need of further research."

We studied two groups of five healthy subjects by (1)H-MRS: the first group was studied before and after both anodal and sham (placebo) tDCS over the right frontal lobe, and the second group was studied at the same intervals without undergoing either sham or anodal tDCS. Anodal tDCS induced a significant increase of mI content at 30 min after stimulation offset (141.5 +/- 16.7%, P < 0.001) below the stimulating electrode but not in distant regions, such as the visual cortex, whereas sham tDCS failed to induce changes in mI. Neither N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA) nor the other metabolite contents changed after anodal or sham stimulation. (1)H-MRS represents a powerful tool to follow the regional effects of tDCS on brain mI and, possibly, on the related phosphoinositide system."

A range of electrotherapy paradigms have been investigated, but no consistent method has been indicated for reporting reproducible stimulation ""dosage."" Anecdotal reports, case studies, and limited clinical trials with small numbers suggest that tDCS may be effective in treating some patients with depression, but methods for selecting the optimal stimulation parameters (""dosage"") are not clear, and there is no conclusive indication that tDCS is an effective treatment for depression. Larger, controlled studies are necessary to determine its safety and efficacy in a clinical setting. If tDCS can be established as an effective treatment for depression, it would represent a particularly attractive electrotherapy option, as it is a relatively benign and affordable treatment modality. An accurate system for describing reproducible treatment parameters is essential so that further studies can yield evidence-based guidelines for the clinical use of transcranial current stimulation. Development of appropriate parameters requires a biophysical understanding of how electrotherapy affects brain function and should include different paradigms for different clinical applications. As with any dosage guidelines, such a system does not supersede physician judgment on safety."
"Modulation of emotions associated with images of human pain using anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS).",Neuropsychologia,2009,212-7,47,Array,Array,18725237,1,"Viewing images of other humans in pain elicits a variety of responses including distress, anxiety, and a sensation that is similar to pain. We aimed to evaluate whether transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) could be effective in modulating the emotional aspects of pain as to further explore mechanisms of tDCS in pain relief. Twenty-three healthy subjects rated images with respect to unpleasantness and discomfort/pain (baseline), and then received stimulation with tDCS under four different conditions of stimulation: anodal tDCS of the left primary motor cortex (M1), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), occipital cortex (V1); and sham tDCS. The order of conditions was randomized and counterbalanced across subjects. During each stimulation session (after 3 min of stimulation), subjects were shown a new set of aversive images and were again asked to rate the images with respect to unpleasantness and discomfort/pain. The results showed that ratings of unpleasantness and discomfort/pain were significantly decreased during DLPFC tDCS only, as compared to baseline and sham tDCS. The other conditions of stimulation (M1 and V1 tDCS) did not result in any significant changes. These results support the notion that DLPFC is a critical area for the emotional processing of pain and also suggests that DLPFC may be a potential target of stimulation for alleviation of pain with a significant emotional-affective component. Our results also suggest that the mechanism of tDCS in modulating emotional pain involve pathways that are independent of those modulating the somatosensory perception of pain."

An improved understanding of the complex circuitry underlying depressive disorders has fostered an explosion in the development of new, nonpharmacological approaches. Each of these treatments seeks to restore normal brain activity via electrical or magnetic stimulation. In this article, the authors discuss the ongoing evolution of neurostimulatory treatments for treatment-resistant depression, reviewing the methods, efficacy, and current research on electroconvulsive therapy, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, magnetic seizure therapy, focal electrically administered stimulated seizure therapy, transcranial direct current stimulation, chronic epidural cortical stimulation, and vagus nerve stimulation. Special attention is given to deep brain stimulation, the most focally targeted approach. The history, purported mechanisms of action, and current research are outlined in detail. Although deep brain stimulation is the most invasive of the neurostimulatory treatments developed to date, it may hold significant promise in alleviating symptoms and improving the quality of life for patients with the most severe and disabling mood disorders."

"Transcranial direct current stimulation and visual perception.",Perception,2008,354-60,37,Array,Array,18491714,3,"Membrane potentials and spike sequences represent the basic modes of cerebral information processing. Both can be externally modulated in humans by quite specific techniques: transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). These methods induce reversible circumscribed cortical excitability changes, either excitatory or inhibitory, outlasting stimulation in time. Experimental pharmacological interventions may selectively enhance the duration of the aftereffects. Whereas rTMS induces externally triggered changes in the neuronal spiking pattern and interrupts or excites neuronal firing in a spatially and temporally restricted fashion, tDCS modulates the spontaneous firing rates of neurons by changing resting-membrane potential. The easiest and most common way of evaluating the cortical excitability changes is by applying TMS to the motor cortex, since it allows reproducible quantification through the motor-evoked potential. Threshold determinations at the visual cortex or psychophysical methods usually require repeated and longer measurements and thus more time for each data set. Here, results derived from the use of tDCS in visual perception, including contrast as well as motion detection and visuo-motor coordination and learning, are summarised. It is demonstrated that visual functions can be transiently altered by tDCS, as has been shown for the motor cortex previously. Up- and down-regulation of different cortical areas by tDCS is likely to open a new branch in the field of visual psychophysics."

"Limited impact of homeostatic plasticity on motor learning in humans.",Neuropsychologia,2008,354-60,46,Array,Array,18394661,8,"Neuroplasticity is the adaptive modification of network connectivity in response to environmental demands and has been identified as a major physiological correlate of learning. Since unrestricted neuroplastic modifications of network connectivity will result in a de-stabilization of the system, metaplastic modification rules have been proposed for keeping plastic connectivity changes within a useful dynamic range. In this connection, the modification threshold to achieve synaptic strengthening is thought to correlate negatively with the history of activity of the respective neurons, i.e. high previous activity enhances the threshold for synaptic strengthening and vice versa. However, the relevance of metaplasticity for actual learning processes has not been tested so far. We reduced or enhanced motor cortex excitability before performance of the serial reaction time task (SRTT), a sequential motor learning paradigm, and a reaction time task (RTT) by transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). If homeostatic rules apply, excitability-diminishing cathodal tDCS should improve subsequent motor learning, especially if combined with the partial NMDA receptor-agonist d-cycloserine, which selectively enhances efficacy of active receptors, while excitability-enhancing anodal tDCS should reduce it. Only the results for anodal tDCS, when combined with d-cycloserine, were in accordance with the rules of homeostatic plasticity. We conclude that homeostatic plasticity, as tested here, has a limited influence on implicit sequential motor learning."
"Noninvasive brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease and dystonia.","Neurotherapeutics : the journal of the American Society for Experimental NeuroTherapeutics",2008,354-60,5,Array,Array,18394576,2,"Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) are promising noninvasive cortical stimulation methods for adjunctive treatment of movement disorders. They avoid surgical risks and provide theoretical advantages of specific neural circuit neuromodulation. Neuromodulatory effects depend on extrinsic stimulation factors (cortical target, frequency, intensity, duration, number of sessions), intrinsic patient factors (disease process, individual variability and symptoms, state of medication treatment), and outcome measures. Most studies to date have shown beneficial effects of rTMS or tDCS on clinical symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) and support the notion of spatial specificity to the effects on motor and nonmotor symptoms. Stimulation parameters have varied widely, however, and some studies are poorly controlled. Studies of rTMS or tDCS in dystonia have provided abundant data on physiology, but few on clinical effects. Multiple mechanisms likely contribute to the clinical effects of rTMS and tDCS in movement disorders, including normalization of cortical excitability, rebalancing of distributed neural network activity, and induction of dopamine release. It remains unclear how to individually adjust rTMS or tDCS factors for the most beneficial effects on symptoms of PD or dystonia. Nonetheless, the noninvasive nature, minimal side effects, positive effects in preliminary clinical studies, and increasing evidence for rational mechanisms make rTMS and tDCS attractive for ongoing investigation."

In this emerging field, major advances in technology have been made in a relatively short period. New stimulation protocols and, especially, the progress in the application of tDCS have made it possible to obtain longer and much clearer inhibitory or facilitatory effects even after the stimulation has ceased. In this introductory review, we outline the basic principles, discuss technical limitations and describe how noninvasive brain stimulation can be used to study human memory functions in vivo.

We attempted to demonstrate the cortical stimulation effect of tDCS on the primary motor cortex (M1) using functional MRI (fMRI). An fMRI study was performed for 11 right-handed healthy subjects at 1.5 T. Anodal tDCS was applied to the scalp over the central knob of the M1 in the left hemisphere. A constant current with an intensity of 1.0 mA was applied. The total fMRI paradigm consisted of three sessions with a 5-min resting period between each session. Each session consisted of five successive phases (resting-tDCS-tDCS-tDCS-tDCS), and each of the phases was performed for 21s. Our findings revealed that no cortical activation was detected in any of the stimulation phases except the fourth tDCS phase. In the result of group analysis for the fourth tDCS phase, the average map indicated that the central knob of the left primary motor cortex was activated.

"Premotor transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) affects primary motor excitability in humans.","The European journal of neuroscience",2008,56-9,27,Array,Array,18312584,5,"Recent studies have shown that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the premotor cortex (PM) modifies the excitability of the ipsilateral primary motor cortex (M1). Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a new method to induce neuroplasticity in humans non-invasively. tDCS generates neuroplasticity directly in the cortical area under the electrode, but might also induce effects in distant brain areas, caused by activity modulation of interconnected areas. However, this has not yet been tested electrophysiologically. We aimed to study whether premotor tDCS can modify the excitability of the ipsilateral M1 via cortico-cortical connectivity. Sixteen subjects received cathodal and anodal tDCS of the PM and eight subjects of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Premotor anodal, but not premotor cathodal or prefrontal tDCS, modified selectively short intracortical inhibition/intracortical facilitation (SICI/ICF), while motor thresholds, single test-pulse motor-evoked potential and input-output curves were stable throughout the experiments. Specifically, anodal tDCS decreased intracortical inhibition and increased paired-pulse excitability. The selective influence of premotor tDCS on intracortical excitability of the ipsilateral M1 suggests a connectivity-driven effect of tDCS on remote cortical areas. Moreover, this finding indirectly substantiates the efficacy of tDCS to modulate premotor excitability, which might be of interest for applications in diseases accompanied by pathological premotor activity."

"A novel approach for treating cerebellar ataxias.","Medical hypotheses",2008,56-9,71,Array,Array,18281160,1,"Transcranial magnetic stimulation is an attractive research and possibly therapeutic tool for non-invasive stimulation of brain tissue. However, relatively little is known about the direction, magnitude and distribution of induced fields and current flow in tissue, and optimal setup characteristics remain largely undetermined. Further, the profound influence of brain size and shape as well as of brain tissue irregularity on actual stimulation patterns is unclear. We model the conductive phenomena induced in brain tissue by TMS by solving the quasistatic problem over a realistic head model of 1mm resolution derived from anatomical MRI scans using a finite difference successive overrelaxation procedure. The magnetic field is calculated from digitized coil geometry and realistic stimulator parameters. Stimulation with a symmetrical primary electric field results in electric field and current density distributions which are highly asymmetrical both in magnitude and in direction (i.e. distributed, non-contiguous stimulation peaks, deviation of stimulated area from coil ""hot spot"", sudden jumps in stimulation intensity and non-zero current flow across tissue interfaces). Knowledge of coil and stimulator specifications alone is hence not sufficient to control stimulation conditions, and a stereotaxic setup coupled with an individually adjusted field solver appears essential in performing reliable TMS studies. Our results bear direct relevance to any application of TMS, both investigative and therapeutic."

However, stimulation in the anodal direction revealed sex-specific effects: in women, anodal stimulation heightened cortical excitability significantly when compared to the age-matched male subject group. There was no significant difference between male and female subjects immediately after stimulation. These results indicate that sex differences exist within the visual cortex of humans, and may be subject to the influences of modulatory neurotransmitters or gonadal hormones which mirror short-term neuroplastic effects."

The aim of the present study was to determine, using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), how the retinotopically organised primary visual cortex (V1) and higher-level, non-retinotopic right lateral temporo-parietal areas interact with facial adaptation processing. Seventeen healthy subjects received 10 min anodal, cathodal or sham stimulation over these areas during a facial adaptation task. Cathodal stimulation of the right temporo-parietal cortex reduces the magnitude of facial adaptation while stimulation over the V1 results in no significant effects. These data imply that mainly lateral temporo-parietal cortical areas play role in facial adaptation and in facial gender discrimination, supporting the idea that the observed after-effects are the result of high-level, configurational adaptation mechanisms."
"Improved naming after transcranial direct current stimulation in aphasia.","Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",2008,805-11,79,Array,Array,10527368,4,"Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has recently undergone a resurgence in popularity as a powerful tool to non-invasively manipulate brain activity. While tDCS has been used to alter functions tied to primary motor and visual cortices, its impact on extrastriate visual areas involved in visuo-spatial processing has not yet been examined. In the current study, we applied tDCS to the cat visuoparietal (VP) cortex and assayed performance in a paradigm designed to assess the capacity to detect, localize and orient to static targets appearing at different spatial eccentricities within the visual field. Real or sham cathodal tDCS was unilaterally applied to the VP cortex, and orienting performance was assessed during (online), immediately after (offline; Experiments 1 and 2), and 1 or 24 h after the end of the tDCS stimulation (Experiment 2). Performance was compared to baseline data collected immediately prior to stimulation. Real, but not sham, tDCS induced significant decreases in performance for static visual targets presented in the contrastimulated visual hemifield. The behavioral impact of tDCS was most apparent during the online and immediate offline periods. The tDCS effect decayed progressively over time and performance returned to baseline levels approximately 60 min after stimulation. These results are consistent with the effects of both invasive and non-invasive deactivation methods applied to the same brain region, and indicate that tDCS has the potential to modify neuronal activity in extrastriate visual regions and to sculpt brain activity and behavior in normal and neurologically impaired subjects."

The aim of the present study was to test if cognitive task and motor exercise practiced during the stimulation are able to modify transcranial direct current stimulation-induced plasticity in the left primary motor cortex in 12 healthy subjects. Motor evoked potentials were recorded before and after 10 min of anodal and cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation. In Experiment 1, subjects were required to sit passively during the stimulation, in Experiment 2 the subject's attention was directed towards a cognitive test and in Experiment 3 subjects were instructed to push a ball in their right hand. Both the cognitive task and motor exercise modified transcranial direct current stimulation-induced plasticity; when performing the cognitive task during stimulation the motor cortex excitability was lower after anodal stimulation and higher after cathodal stimulation, compared with the passive condition. When performing the motor exercise, the motor cortex excitability was lower after both anodal and cathodal stimulation, compared with the passive condition. Our results show that transcranial direct current stimulation-induced plasticity is highly dependent on the state of the subject during stimulation."

In eight normal volunteers, motor evoked potentials (MEPs) induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) were recorded from the right first dorsal interosseous muscle, and tDCS was given with electrodes over the left primary motor cortex (M1) and the contralateral orbit. We performed two experiments: one for short duration tDCS (100 ms, 1, 3 or 5 mA) and the other for long duration tDCS (10 min, 1 mA). The stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) between the onset of tDCS and TMS were 1-7 and 10-120 ms for the former experiment. In the latter experiment, TMS was given 0-20 min after the end of 10 min tDCS. We evaluated the effect of tDCS on the motor cortex by comparing MEPs conditioned by tDCS with control MEPs. Cathodal short duration tDCS significantly reduced the size of responses to motor cortical stimulation at SOAs of 1-7 ms when the intensity was equal to or greater than 3 mA. Anodal short duration tDCS significantly increased MEPs when the intensity was 3 mA, but the enhancement did not occur when using 5 mA conditioning stimulus. Moreover, both anodal and cathodal short duration tDCS decreased responses to TMS significantly at SOAs of 20-50 ms and enhanced them at an SOA of 90 ms. Long duration cathodal tDCS decreased MEPs at 0 and 5 min after the offset of tDCS and anodal long duration tDCS increased them at 1 and 15 min. We conclude that the effect at SOAs less than 10 ms is mainly caused by acute changes in resting membrane potential induced by tDCS. The effect at SOAs of 20-100 ms is considered to be a nonspecific effect of a startle-like response produced by activation of skin sensation at the scalp. The effect provoked by long duration tDCS may be short-term potentiation or depression like effects."

Therapeutic effects have been demonstrated in clinical trials of tDCS for a variety of conditions including tinnitus, post-stroke motor deficits, fibromyalgia, depression, epilepsy and Parkinson's disease. Its effects can be modulated by combination with pharmacological treatment and it may influence the efficacy of other neurostimulatory techniques such as transcranial magnetic stimulation. CVS involves irrigating the auditory canal with cold water which induces a temperature gradient across the semicircular canals of the vestibular apparatus. This has been shown in functional brain-imaging studies to result in activation in several contralateral cortical and subcortical brain regions. CVS has also been shown to have effects on a wide range of visual and cognitive phenomena, as well as on post-stroke conditions, mania and chronic pain states. Both these techniques have been shown to modulate a range of brain functions, and display potential as clinical treatments. Importantly, they are both inexpensive relative to other brain stimulation techniques such as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)."

Cognitive enhancement as a result of tDCS has been reported. The purpose of this study was to test whether weak tDCS (current density, 57 microA/cm(2)) can be used to modify language processing. Fifteen healthy subjects performed a visual picture naming task before, during and after tDCS applied over the posterior perisylvian region (PPR), i.e. an area which includes Wernicke's area [BA 22]. Four different sessions were carried out: (1) anodal and (2) cathodal stimulation of left PPR and, for control, (3) anodal stimulation of the homologous region of the right hemisphere and (4) sham stimulation. We found that subjects responded significantly faster following anodal tDCS to the left PPR (p<0.01). No decreases in performance were detected. Our finding of a transient improvement in a language task following the application of tDCS together with previous studies which investigated the modulation of picture naming latency by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and repetitive TMS (rTMS) suggest that tDCS applied to the left PPR (including Wernicke's area [BA 22]) can be used to enhance language processing in healthy subjects. Whether this safe, low cost, and easy to use brain stimulation technique can be used to ameliorate deficits of picture naming in aphasic patients needs further investigations."

To investigate whether manipulation of brain excitability by transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS; 1.5 mA, 10 min, 0.026 C/cm(2)) modulates neuromuscular fatigue, we evaluated the effect of brain polarization over the right motor areas of the cerebral cortex of healthy subjects on the endurance time for a submaximal isometric contraction of left elbow flexors. In 24 healthy volunteers the study protocol comprised an assessment of the maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) for the left elbow flexors and a fatiguing isometric contraction (35% of MVC), before and immediately after brain polarization. One hour elapsed between baseline (T0) and postconditioning (T1) evaluation. After tDCS, MVC remained unchanged from baseline (mean +/- SEM; anodal tDCS: T0, 154.4 +/- 18.07; T1, 142.8 +/- 16.62 N; cathodal tDCS: T0, 156 +/- 18.75; T1, 141.86 +/- 17.53 N; controls: T0, 148.8 +/- 6.64; T1, 137.6 +/- 7.36 N; P > 0.1).

None of the evaluated electromyographic variables changed after tDCS. Anodal tDCS could improve endurance time by directly modulating motor cortical excitability, modulating premotor areas, decreasing fatigue-related muscle pain, increasing motivation and improving synergist muscle coupling. Our findings, showing that anodal tDCS over the motor areas of the cerebral cortex improves muscle endurance, open the way to increasing muscle endurance and decreasing muscle fatigue in normal (i.e. sports medicine) and pathological conditions."

This plastic response includes compensatory changes that prove adaptive for the individual, as well as changes that contribute to functional disability and are, therefore, maladaptive. In this context, brain stimulation techniques tailored to modulate individual plastic changes associated with neurological diseases might enhance clinical benefits and minimize adverse effects. In this Review, we discuss the use of two noninvasive brain stimulation techniques--repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial direct current stimulation--to modulate activity in the targeted cortex or in a dysfunctional network, to restore an adaptive equilibrium in a disrupted network for best behavioral outcome, and to suppress plastic changes for functional advantage. We review randomized controlled studies, in focal epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, recovery from stroke, and chronic pain, to illustrate these principles, and we present evidence for the clinical effects of these two techniques."
"Activation of prefrontal cortex by transcranial direct current stimulation reduces appetite for risk during ambiguous decision making.","The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience",2007,55-60,27,Array,Array,12642045,23,"Dopamine (DA) simultaneously produces both excitation and inhibition in the human cortex. In order to shed light on the functional significance of these seemingly opposing effects, we administered the DA precursor levodopa (L-dopa) to healthy subjects in conjunction with 2 neuroplasticity-inducing motor cortex stimulation protocols. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) induces cortical excitability enhancement by anodal and depression by cathodal brain polarization, which is not restricted to specific subgroups of synapses. In contrast, paired associative stimulation (PAS) induces focal excitability enhancements of somatosensory and motor cortical neuronal synaptic connections. Here, we show that administering L-dopa turns the unspecific excitability enhancement caused by anodal tDCS into inhibition and prolongs the cathodal tDCS-induced excitability diminution. Conversely, it stabilizes the PAS-induced synapse-specific excitability increase. Most importantly, it prolongs all of these aftereffects by a factor of about 20. Hereby, DA focuses synapse-specific excitability-enhancing neuroplasticity in human cortical networks."

"Transcranial direct current stimulation reveals inhibitory deficiency in migraine.","Cephalalgia : an international journal of headache",2007,55-60,27,Array,Array,12942146,7,"As adult humans, we are continuously faced with decisions in which proper weighing of the risk involved is critical. Excessively risky or overly cautious decision making can both have disastrous real-world consequences. Weighing of risks and benefits toward decision making involves a complex neural network that includes the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), but its role remains unclear. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation studies have shown that disruption of the DLPFC increases risk-taking behavior. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) allows upregulation of activity in the DLPFC, and we predicted that it might promote more cautious decision making. Healthy participants received one of the following treatments while they performed the Balloon Analog Risk Task: (1) right anodal/left cathodal DLPFC tDCS, (2) left anodal/right cathodal DLPFC tDCS, or (3) sham tDCS. This experiment revealed that participants receiving either one of the bilateral DLPFC tDCS strategies adopted a risk-averse response style. In a control experiment, we tested whether unilateral DLPFC stimulation (anodal tDCS over the right or left DLPFC with the cathodal electrode over the contralateral supraorbital area) was sufficient to decrease risk-taking behaviors. This experiment showed no difference in decision-making behaviors between the groups of unilateral DLPFC stimulation and sham stimulation. These findings extend the notion that DLPFC activity is critical for adaptive decision making, possibly by suppressing riskier responses. Anodal tDCS over DLPFC by itself did not significantly change risk-taking behaviors; however, when the contralateral DLPFC was modulated with cathodal tCDS, an important decrease in risk taking was observed. Also, the induced cautious decision-making behavior was observed only when activity of both DLPFCs was modulated. The ability to modify risk-taking behavior may be translated into therapeutic interventions for disorders such as drug abuse, overeating, or pathological gambling."

The aim of this paper is to summarize the partially adverse effects of 567 tDCS sessions over motor and non-motor cortical areas (occipital, temporal, parietal) from the last 2 years, on work performed in our laboratories. One-hundred and two of our subjects who participated in our tDCS studies completed a questionnaire. The questionnaire contained rating scales regarding the presence and severity of headache, difficulties in concentrating, acute mood changes, visual perceptual changes and any discomforting sensation like pain, tingling, itching or burning under the electrodes, during and after tDCS. Participants were healthy subjects (75.5%), migraine patients (8.8%), post-stroke patients (5.9%) and tinnitus patients (9.8%). During tDCS a mild tingling sensation was the most common reported adverse effect (70.6%), moderate fatigue was felt by 35.3% of the subjects, whereas a light itching sensation under the stimulation electrodes occurred in 30.4% of cases. After tDCS headache (11.8%), nausea (2.9%) and insomnia (0.98%) were reported, but fairly infrequently. In addition, the incidence of the itching sensation (p=0.02) and the intensity of tingling sensation (p=0.02) were significantly higher during tDCS in the group of the healthy subjects, in comparison to patients; whereas the occurrence of headache was significantly higher in the patient group (p=0.03) after the stimulation.

Following demonstration of disruption of performance on psychological tasks closely linked to cingulate function using this TMS technique, the current study aimed to directly measure the regional distribution of physiological effects of stimulation in the brain with H2(15)O PET. Experiment 1 assessed the effect of increasing numbers of pulse trains of TMS on regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF). Experiment 2 assessed the capacity of medial frontal TMS to modulate brain activity associated with the Stroop task using medial parietal TMS as a control site of stimulation. SPM99 analyses, using the ACC as a region of interest, revealed clusters of increased rCBF during medial frontal TMS in Brodmann area 24 and reduced rCBF in more ventral ACC, the latter occurring in both experiments. In a whole-brain analysis, striking changes in rCBF were observed distal to the ACC following medial frontal TMS. Although TMS reliably affected Stroop task performance in early trials, there was no interaction between TMS and Stroop condition in rCBF. Our results suggest that medial frontal TMS using the double-cone coil can affect ACC activity. However, a number of more distal cortical areas were also affected in these experiments. These additional changes may reflect either 'downstream' effects of altered cingulate cortex activity or direct effects of the coil."
"Recent advances in the treatment of chronic pain with non-invasive brain stimulation techniques.","Lancet neurology",2007,9-15,6,Array,Array,17239806,2,"Associative neuroplasticity, which encompasses the modification of synaptic strength by coactivation of two synaptic inputs, has been linked to learning processes. Because unlimited plasticity destabilizes neuronal networks, homeostatic rules were proposed and experimentally proven that control for the amount and direction of plasticity dependent on background network activity. Accordingly, low background activity would enhance facilitatory plasticity, whereas high background activity would inhibit it. However, the impact of background excitability on associative plasticity has not been studied so far in humans. Facilitatory associative plasticity was induced by paired associative stimulation (PAS) in the human motor cortex, whereas background activity was enhanced or diminished by transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). When applied before PAS, excitability-enhancing tDCS also boosted the efficacy of PAS, whereas excitability-diminishing tDCS turned it into inhibition. Thus, previous background activity does not influence associative plasticity homeostatically. When tDCS and PAS were applied simultaneously, now in accordance with homeostatic rules of neuroplasticity, reduced background activity resulted in a prolonged excitability enhancement by PAS, whereas enhanced background activity turned it into inhibition. We conclude that background network activity can influence associative plasticity homeostatically. However, only simultaneous modulation of both parameters is in accordance with homeostatic concepts. These findings might be of importance for the development of plasticity-inducing stimulation protocols supporting information processing in humans."

This view is supported by neuroimaging evidence for a correlation between the longer reaction times caused by high PI conditions of a working memory task and increased activity in left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) of the prefrontal cortex. An alternative that has never been ruled out, however, is that this left IFG effect may merely reflect sensitivity to such nonspecific factors as difficulty and/or time on task. To resolve this confound, we applied the interference methodology of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to the left IFG and two control regions while subjects performed delayed letter recognition. rTMS was guided with high-resolution magnetic resonance images and was time-locked to the onset of the memory probe. The effect of rTMS, a disruption of accuracy restricted to high-PI probes, was specific to the left IFG. These results demonstrate that unpredictable, phasic disruption of the left IFG selectively disrupts control of responses to high-conflict verbal working memory probes, and they conclusively reject nonspecific alternative accounts."
"Effects of transcranial direct current stimulation coupled with repetitive electrical stimulation on cortical spreading depression.","Experimental neurology",2007,91-8,204,Array,Array,12455679,1,"Advanced brain imaging technologies have been used recently to investigate neuroplasticity in relation to recovery and treatment of neurologic injury and disease. The contributors to this supplement present data and synthesize the extant literature on the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, optical imaging, transcranial magnetic stimulation, and transcranial direct current stimulation to study remodeling of cortical representation of motor and cognitive abilities after stroke and other etiologies of neurologic impairment. In general, the collective findings of these studies support use-dependent neuroplasticity as a mechanism of recovery and response to training. Brain imaging findings support the role of training effects on increased activation of brain regions ipsilateral to unilateral vascular lesions in facilitating recovery from stroke. The articles in this supplement also report the potential therapeutic application of stimulation techniques to enhance reorganization of function."
